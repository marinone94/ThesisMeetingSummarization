A	80.5	81.66	Tu tu tu tu 	
A	83.22	84.03	Hi , good morning . 	
B	95.68	115.89	we will do some stuff , get to know each other a bit better to feel more comfortable with each other . Um then we'll go do tool training , talk about the project plan , discuss our own ideas and everything um and we've got twenty five minutes to do that , as far as I can understand . 	
B	117.62	160.95	Now , we're developing a remote control which you probably already know . Um , we want it to be original , something that's uh people haven't thought of , that's not out in the shops , um , trendy , appealing to a wide market , but you know , not a hunk of metal , and user-friendly , grannies to kids , maybe even pooches should be able to use it . Okay , um , first is the functional design , um this is where we all go off and do our individual work , um what needs need to be fulfilled by the product , um what effects the product has to have and how it's actually going to do that . Um , conceptual design , 	
B	162.31	167.8	what we're thinking , how it's gonna go and then the detailed design , how we're actually gonna put it into practice and make it work . 	
A	168.79	168.88	'Kay . 	
B	170.38	186.128	Okay , right . We're gonna practice with the pens and draw our favourite animal on the white board , I'll go first , and um sum up the characteristics of that animal . So 	
A	180.246	181.722

B	246.93	250.6	Okay . I'm not gonna ask you to guess , I'm going to tell you that's supposed to be a tiger . 	
A	252.48	252.56	Mm . 	
B	254.53	257.24	And I see them as majestic , 	
A	255.91	256.25	Oh sorry .

A	285.15	286.61	Where did this come from ? 	
B	287.57	290.1	Is that your lapel then ? There you go . 	
A	289.09	296.02	Uh , yep . Thank you . Uh , maybe you can guess what I'm trying to make ? 	
D	306.38	307.2	A kind of dog ? 	
B	307.225	308.062		
A	309.22	310.08	Yep . 	
A	313.47	321.86	It's actually sitting , so it's sitting , it's not standing . Okay , I see it as one thing it's very supportive . 	
C	315.696	317.4	It's sitting down . 	
D	315.85	316.3	Sorry ? 	
D	317.9	318.62	Uh . 	
A	324.13	351.47	It's your best friend and your you can talk to a dog , it can be your best friend , it doesn't discriminate between you , based on what you are . Second it's loyal and third thing it's got intuition . dogs can som sometimes can make out between a thief and a person so basically these are the three unique features I think belong to a dog . Thank you . 	
D	344.91	345.36	Mm-hmm . 	
B	350.01	351.09	Okay , thank you . 	
C	353.48	355.55	Yeah I'll have a go .

C	356.98	357.37	Thanks . 	
B	358.816	360.912		
C	359.11	367.65	Alright , okay . Well since you guys have chosen the ones I wanted to do , I'll have to have to go for something a bit random . 	
A	364.336	367.84	Does it look like a dog actually ? 	
B	364.608	366.01	Okay . 	
C	371.43	375.29	And also , my drawing skill isn't that great so , yeah . 	
D	373.52	374.626		
B	373.84	376.864	Well , as you can see , the quality of the work today is um 	
A	375.08	375.43	Mm . 	
D	376.8	379.584	I think it's outstandingly good . 	
B	377.914	379.452		
C	379.6	384.48	Okay , now I'm gonna have to change what is was originally gonna be because that looks like a beak now , so . 	
B	382.048	383.223		
C	390.412	406.27	Yeah , it can be a crocodile , it can be a crocodile . Well it was it was an at first firstly it was an attempt at a T_ Rex and then it sort of changed into a pelican but it can be a crocodile now actually . 	
D	391.13	391.74	Crocodile ? 	
B	393.99	394.92	Gonna be a bird . 	
B	396.31	399.8	Is it gonna be it's gonna be a bird .

C	445.23	446.682	Uh uh 	
C	450.45	451.744	Wo 	
D	454.0	456.94	I hope that clicks in , I'll just I'll hold it on , okay . 	
C	456.505	456.992		
B	456.912	458.633		
D	457.97	460.57	Oops , oh dear , what happened there ? 	
B	461.09	462.16	Technical help . 	
D	465.38	470.88	Hopefully that'll stay on , two-handed version . Okay , uh 	
C	465.48	465.99	Hmm . 	
C	467.94	468.7	Okay . 	
D	474.41	479.35	Again this is off the top of my head , I was gonna do a big cat too , um . 	
C	476.71	477.792	Uh 	
D	481.26	484.68	Oh dear , it doesn't look what like what I want it to be . 	
B	481.27	481.66	Hmm . 	
C	484.48	484.72	S 	
D	487.1	487.71	Uh . 	
C	487.43	487.92	Uh 	
D	488.77	491.41	It's not a vampire bat honestly . 	
C	488.812	491.385		
B	489.66	491.34	Okay , yeah . 	
D	492.9	518.66	Uh and somewhere there's a body behind . That's my dreadful that's the worst yet , that's it's meant to be an eagle you can tell it's a flying animal could have been a seagull , I never thought of a seagull . An eagle , um again I'm thinking on my feet goodness . I suppose they're all so independent , I'd put that one down again . Da dum um . 	
C	497.4	499.98	Okay , some sort of bird . 	
B	501.19	504.66	A seagu right , not a seagull . 	
C	501.76	503.22	Ah eagle , right okay . 	
A	501.78	502.67	Eagle , okay . 	
C	519.87	520.95	They're good at golf . 	
D	520.28	536.6	Indepen independent , right , did you say they're good at golf ? Are they ? Oh . Oh right , okay , I'm not good at golf . I'd say they're quite free-spirited , flying around everywhere , doing their own thing . 	
B	524.131	525.96	Eagle . 	
C	524.31	529.024	Yeah , no yeah , an eagle . 	
B	527.237	529.002		
D	541.43	549.53	And uh , birds of prey aren't they , oh dear , intrepid . I'll put that , intrepid . 	
B	545.31	545.64	Mm-hmm . 	
B	547.101	547.952		
D	553.66	556.77	There we go , hope that pen's gonna be okay . 	
B	554.48	555.15	That's lovely . 	
B	558.112	559.777		
D	558.67	559.33	Whoops . 	
C	559.504	559.872		
B	561.11	561.6	Okay . 	
B	563.12	575.32	That was fun , right . Um finance-wise , we've got a selling price at twenty five Euros , which I don't actually know what that is in Pounds , at all . Any ideas ? 	
C	575.11	577.66	It's about mm , mm yeah . 	
D	576.51	577.21	Seventeen . 	
A	576.76	581.5	One point four or something like that . One point four Euro would make a Pound or something like that . 	
C	580.85	587.57	Yeah , yeah , something like that , so that yeah about seventeen , seventeen Pounds , something like that . 	
A	582.6	582.92	Yeah . 	
B	583.85	587.98	D fifteen ? Seventeen . Okay , that's expensive . 	
D	584.88	585.97	Seventeen Pounds . 	
D	588.37	592.28	Should we be making notes of this ? We can just refer to this later can't we ? Yeah , okay . 	
C	590.86	591.37	But 	
B	590.98	595.93	I think so , I think so , I'll be able to um pull it up , or I could put it in the shared folder or something . 	
D	593.81	594.27	Okay . 	
C	594.19	608.09	Havi having said that though , if you wanna get one of those the the ones on the market at the moment they're s they're about twenty pounds anyway . So , it'd still be yeah , we had to buy one . 	
D	603.51	604.22	Right . 	
B	603.88	604.22	Really ? 	
D	605.84	606.02	So 	
B	606.66	607.02	Mm . 	
D	608.09	613.93	so I suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price , we d or or is it going to make our product look a cheapie-cheapie option ? 	
B	608.13	609.291	I think 	
B	613.51	617.82	Yeah , um production cost's at twelve fifty , so 	
C	614.07	614.89	Hmm . 	
A	617.54	619.59	Okay , pretty huge margin . 	
B	619.13	629.44	half of the selling price is taken up by building it . Um , and profit aim is fifty million Euros , which is uh 	
C	621.46	622.16	Yeah . 	
D	622.02	622.23	Mm . 	
D	623.85	624.23	Mm-hmm . 	
D	630.37	631.2	In our first year ? 	
B	631.29	637.195	Yi yes , um yeah , I presume so . Um 	
D	635.54	635.88	Mm-hmm . 	
A	636.39	637.104	So then 	
D	638.1	651.49	You've got market range international and you did say earlier it's got to be a um accessible and usable by sort of all age groups just t we're not focusing on business market , any particular thing , it's everyone user-friendly to everyone . Okay . 	
B	645.18	645.59	Mm-hmm . 	
B	649.13	650.29	No , yeah . 	
D	653.41	655.4	Big target group . 	
B	653.57	670.24	So yes , yes , I don't think we have to I don't think it's a case of worrying about different languages and things like that , um making that a key point , just that it's going to be in the international market like Australia , America , things like that . Okay . 	
D	661.85	662.2	No . 	
D	666.69	666.94	Mm . 	
B	675.2	704.832	What are your experiences with remote controls ? I mean I've got we got um we had three videos , a T_V_ and a sort of amp thing all set up so we got one of the universal remote controls , um that you programme each of your things into , but that kept losing the signals so we'd have to re-programme it every now and again . I think it was quite a cheapie as well , so that might have had something to do with it , but that was quite good , the fact that you could 	
A	687.25	687.56	Mm-hmm . 	
C	688.13	688.44	Yeah . 	
D	691.12	691.89	Alright . 	
C	691.23	692.13	Yeah . 	
A	691.49	692.22	Yeah , that c 	
D	701.09	701.69	Mm-hmm . 	
C	701.1	701.88	Yeah uh . 	
C	705.18	706.72	Use all the ones at the same time . 	
B	705.96	708.91	You didn't have six remote controls sitting in front of you . 	
D	708.07	708.55	Right . 	
A	708.61	711.04	Okay , you wanna integrate everything into one like 	
C	711.24	713.328	Yeah , 'cause you 	
D	711.88	736.05	Mm-hmm . My experience has only been being given the remote control with the object I buy , not doing any tampering with it and programming , using it to programme T_V_ and uh uh videos and things . But basically on , off , volume up and down , channel one , two , th that basic functions , I don't think I could go any further with it than that , so , I suppose it's got to be something usable by someone like me as well . 	
A	712.33	712.72	Okay . 	
B	727.67	728.16	Mm . 	
B	734.98	751.76	Yeah , the main that's the main stuff anyway , I mean and you don't want to I hate I hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do and just sitting there searching for the teletext button or something like that . 	
D	737.29	737.67	Mm-hmm . 	
D	746.42	746.84	Mm . 	
C	747.66	747.95	Yeah . 	
D	749.82	755.29	Mm . And symbols that you don't necessarily understand , symbols you're meant to understand that you don't . 	
B	752.59	752.95	Yeah . 	
B	754.864	755.92	Um . 	
A	755.18	758.06	So simplification of symbols you could think of . 	
B	757.43	779.79	When they're when you've got the main things on the front of it and a section opens up or something to the other functions where you can do sound or options kind of recording , things like that inside it . 'Cause it doesn't make when you pick it up it doesn't make it really complicated to look at , it's obvious what you're doing , um . 	
D	768.52	768.98	Oh yeah . 	
D	772.32	772.69	Mm-hmm . 	
D	775.6	775.84	Mm . 	
D	777.34	777.65	Mm-hmm . 	
C	777.92	778.66	Mm . 	
D	779.78	794.48	Actually that just raises a point , I wonder what our design people think , but you know on a mobile phone , you can press a key and it gives you a menu , it's got a menu display , I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful , so you've got a little L_C_D_ display . 	
A	784.99	785.28	Mm-hmm . 	
A	787.08	787.74	Menu , alright . 	
C	792.17	792.62	Yeah . 	
A	792.89	793.601	Uh uh 	
A	794.46	812.03	Right , I was thinking on the same lines you , instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user , may h maybe have an L_C_D_ di display or something like that , like a mobile , yeah and with menus . And if it's s somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone , people might find it easier to browse and navigate also maybe . 	
D	803.8	805.92	With menus , yeah , yeah . 	
D	811.15	811.49	Yeah . 	
B	812.35	815.09	What about the older generation ? What about granny and grandads ? 	
A	815.216	818.96	You mean to save it lesser number . 	
B	816.15	823.63	Um , my grandad can answer his mobile phone , but he couldn't even dream of texting or something like that . 	
C	819.96	820.26	Yeah . 	
D	821.35	827.97	Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Can he programme his remote control or is it basic with that too ? 	
A	826.06	826.35	Right . 	
B	828.12	831.516	I don't think they tape things , I don't think they use 	
C	829.37	834.05	Yeah , my grandad's actually better than me at using teletext , so . 	
D	830.05	830.6	Right . 	
D	833.26	833.8	Right . 	
D	834.64	844.64	So that's a problem regardless of of any design modifications you you come up with , that's gonna be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps , and that's another issue how we tackle that . 	
C	838.64	839.0	Yeah . 	
B	841.2	843.24	Mm , yeah , the age gap . 	
C	843.73	849.58	Yeah , what it just needs to be as long as it's sort of self-intuitive and you can can work out 	
C	850.98	861.94	what everything's doing , 'cause I mean , menus on sort of new phones now they've sort of got all these pictures and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you're trying to do . 	
B	862.33	862.76	Mm . 	
A	863.21	863.53	Mm-hmm . 	
B	864.3	871.74	I don't know , I d I don't like the , you know the new phones that have kind of got a Windows-based running system . 	
C	864.43	865.885	But I don't know how 	
C	870.18	870.69	Oh yeah . 	
D	872.2	872.59	Mm-hmm . 	
B	872.95	883.24	I find it really confusing , I kept getting lost in the phone , I di I've not got a new one but uh my friend got a new one and I was trying to do things with it and I just kept getting lost , but 	
D	878.36	878.8	Right . 	
B	884.38	885.17	that's just me . 	
C	885.18	899.31	Yeah , I don't I don't know how for twenty fi , or twelve Euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get , you'd you'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white L_C_D_ thing anyway , I'd assume . 	
D	885.286	885.89		
B	893.63	894.31	Yeah . 	
D	895.43	895.75	Mm-hmm . 	
D	898.71	911.78	Is it possible that that for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for large print like you do in large print books ? Obviously it displays less on the screen , it displays less on the screen but as long as they can read it that's the main thing . 	
A	905.32	905.7	Okay . 	
B	905.77	907.5	Teletext has got that option as well . 	
B	911.86	912.35	Yeah . 	
B	913.69	934.88	Or what about kind of a dual function ? In that you've got the basic buttons just for your play , volume , programme things and also and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures , obvious symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that . 	
D	923.65	924.04	Mm-hmm . 	
D	930.704	931.44	Yeah . 	
D	932.99	933.37	Mm-hmm . 	
D	934.74	947.56	Mm . The other thing is , just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again , it could have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top , your screen is you can have a bigger screen in the the flip over . 	
B	945.43	945.84	Mm-hmm . 	
A	946.04	946.66	Mm , okay . 	
B	948.48	953.165	I think that's a cost thing , I don't I don't know how much we're gonna know about 	
A	948.6	949.09	S 	
C	949.9	950.21	Y 	
A	950.91	959.24	It might it might save a b bit of space , it's i instead of looking bulky , it might look small . But it might have its cost implications .

B	959.48	960.29	Okay . 	
D	959.69	972.975	And there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone , it can still be lightweight plastic , you know ? Something that's easily moulded and produced . Sorry I'm treading on your territory guys . 	
B	965.1	965.57	Mm . 	
A	966.22	966.48	Right .
