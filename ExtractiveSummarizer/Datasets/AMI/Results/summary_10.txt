Hello everyone .   
 Hi . Hi .   Uh first we going uh over the minutes of the last meeting , more or less . Um in the last meeting uh the marketing manager had presented uh her method of working , meaning gathering i suggestions   Uh in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use .          In addition to that to make it sell , of course , uh the marketing manager w wishes that it be very attractive , or like she says put some sizzle into it in one way or another so that the people are buying it now because , in particular with smaller items , that's a very important fact , 'cause um if they say , well , I go home and think about it , that won't work . Um also mentioned was it should be uh it should have a very short learning curve .     Therefore , messages uh will be controlled in the same manner . There should be extra features like lid buttons , maybe a beep .         Francino who is our um interface designer um uh has mentioned that the that it , of course , should have an on-off button , and also has mentioned an interesting feature that it should have maybe a channel lock .         And maybe have an anar alarm-clock .   Uh the different systems uh that exist are infra-red or radio-waves . Uh maybe it should have uh electri electrici electricity saving feature .         Okay , then we I'm looking for three presentations .   whoever w wants Okay , I can start first .     Oh , come on , close already . And that's number two , right ? Three . Three . Participant three .         This messages could be uh switch on-off message or switch to next channel message or swapping the channels or switching onto a particular channel , like you can have the numbers one , two , three , four , up to nine . Nine what ? Nine channel uh switches ?   Nine channel switches ? Yes , nine numbers . And then you have swapping of uh button by which using which you can swap the channels if you don't want to see the third channel you can swap it to the fourth channel or vice versa .       For example , if you are watching a French program and you would like to have a subtitles in English , then there should be a channel which can trigger this mechanism in the television so that the user can see uh the the subtitles on the screen .   Now there should be a memory switch .   Suddenly if if if uh uh viewer he gets a telephone call , and if he want he doesn't want to switch off the uh T_V_ , but he he can reduce the sound , he can bring the volume down and he can watch he can uh while talking he can watch the T_V_ .     
 So a remote can be th can be uh designed which can have the voice recognisers , you can record your own voice which can be recognised by as voice recogniser in the television , for example , if you want to see we if you want to see the ninth channel if you say just say ninth channel , uh th now the the   So the T_V_ will have some recogniser which will recognise the user's voice and accordingly it will change its functionalities . So this is one of the very important feature a remote control can have . So this is one one of the interface which can be created . Then , please , next slide . Then , these are some of the remotes which are different in shape and colour , but they have many buttons .   So you can you can design an interface which is very simple , and which is user-friendly .   So can you go on t t uh to the next slide . Yeah , so this is one of the interface or one of the remote which has this vi voice recogniser .     Can you go on to the next slide ?         Next slide , please .       and it's impossible to im misplace or lose . And the personal preference uh would be a spe uh uh to incorporate speech recognisers uh which will respond to user's voice for a particular uh function . Thank you , that's Mm-hmm . Okay , thank you very much . Uh any comments on uh her presentation ? 
 Well , um looks like we still have quite a choice of things out there . I don't think that we can get uh The T-shape is good , the child one is good , the too big to misplace , I think it's just funny . No , I think the these are her presentations , but uh as far as the decision making we getting to that after after         Participant two . Uh the next one , sorry . It's it was the old one .       I have just brief uh down few uh components which we require for the remote control uh construction . Uh the first one is case to keep all the components like integrated circuit , battery , etcetera , etcetera , it's like Uh it can be a plastic one , hard plastic , so that it can be strong , even if you just uh uh , you know , if you if it falls down , then it doesn't break .   And uh uh there are no harmful materials used in that .   Uh and uh , yeah , and also uh using of colouring compon components like uh if we want to have different colours , blue , red , green , so uh uh we have to use uh some colouring compone compone components . Good point . 
  And uh the second important thing is uh uh uh integrated circuit .                 I think it's   Can you go on to the next slide , please ? Uh a diode , a transistor , a resonator , these are all this uh technical uh electri electronic compons uh components which are which we have to use in a remote controller . A battery uh , I would like to suggest one thing uh uh if we will be able to make a res rechargeable battery then we sh we need not go for a high performance battery , even if it is a low performance battery it ca it can't l it can't charge much . it's not a high voltage battery . Then also we can If it is a rechargeable one , then uh people can use it for a long time , so in that way we can cut cut the cost , but w uh uh that we have to make the battery as rechargeable one . 
 And we we have a circuit board uh in a remote controller .             Suppose you have pressed channel one button , number one you have pressed , then the uh chip will know that the number one button was pressed . It pros produces a mors morse code line signal specific to that button .   Suppose uh the uh user has pressed butto button one , then it will have a spe the circuit will generate a specific morse code to b that that button , and the transistor will amplify the signal and send then to the L_E_D_ which translates the signal into infrared light .         It will amplify the signal and it will send it to the L_E_D_ and which translates the signal into an infra infrared bits . The sensor on the T_V_ can see the infrared light , and seeing the signal seeing the signal re it reacts appropriately , that when it sees the amplified mo morse code signal , then it will uh it will uh know which uh what what action it has to uh do .                   And uh if you open the remote controller you have this circui circuit board and few electronic components , like you can see a chip there which is having eighteen pins , and also a capac uh a capacitor , three resistors and also a resonator uh um mm       uh you can see the T_A_ double one eight three five labelled uh chip um .     Uh you can also see the uh uh the green two green things are uh these are they are they are resistors , and uh just beside that you can see a transistor , and a uh uh cylinder shape , uh that one is a capacitor . Uh and also there are uh um resistors uh sorry , ther there is a diode .     The green one is a circuit board . Actually , uh building a circuit bo board is pretty pretty uh easy and also it's     It's not exactly wires we are using .   Tha tho those prints will acti act as wires and ci uh circuits .     and it will uh it will ch its ch se send a signal signals to the , yeah , um integrated circuit .     Uh so this is these are the circuits un underneath the buttons . Uh can you see the black uh , round marks ?         Uh b but a b a push-button requires a simple chip underneath it , but whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range .   and k uh uh uh full a complete chip . Uh and a as energy source we offer a basic battery , a more ingenious uh hard dynamo , um a kinetic provision of energy , more than what is that you shake casually to provide energy .     
 Uh yeah uh the product can be de delivered into different cases .     Uh we have five minutes to the end of the meeting . Yeah , maybe d uh I have just one more slide , I think . Like we can have a ma material such as plastic , rubber , wood , titanium , but titanium we can't use .                 No , no , no , th the the the scrolling wheels are different , like you can go for a sw switches like buttons or scrolls , uh which which we used to do before ten ten years before , I think .             Go right to my first my next slide . Um alright , my method is uh I'm interested in what the competition is doing , and wanna see how we can make ourselves different from the competition , so I've really been looking at the press and the ads that are out there for other remote controllers . I s I spend a lot of time on the internet um surfing around doing the same thing . And then when I'm out um in people's houses or at meetings or anything like that , I try to notice what kind of remote controls people have , and if it's convenient in the conversation I ask about it . And I would encourage you all to do the same . Um and my findings from this is that , you know , small is beautiful .   Simple is beautiful .     And eye-catching is important .   Go ahead , I'm trying to finish fast for you . Um and our preference is , as far as I'm concerned , are we got to get to the market before the competition . Ours has to be look really great and it has to come out before the others , so that we have a leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out their Christmas item . And we should develop one or two features we can really dwell on in our ad campaign . If we try to tell people it has too many great features , um the consumer just gets confused and we don't get anywhere . So we've gotta narrow our selection down to li two things , I think , that we gonna say are really great about our our our new product .   And in my research this year I found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular .       Kay .   And what we really have to decide in this meeting is um the concept of the remote . And uh so what do we think on the concept     Uh yes , I would like to include this feature which is called as voice recogniser .   This could be uh one feature which could be sellable .         but I what I'm uh very very much doubtful how how uh far it will work , because a speech recogniser like i it it has its own uh uh problems , issues .         Well , you you teach You have to teach uh   it's like your recording of uh all uh um a question already , and then you're expecting an answer from th For example , you have a T_V_ system , I'm the user and my family members are the user , I will already record uh a question like , uh good morning , like around eight o'clock       Okay , before we get too far off here um , the components of the concept is the energy . 
 What kind of energy do we foresee ?                                     User interface concept , uh interface type , supplements . That will be your area I think , right , Jana .     Put uh k I guess uh for yeah .   Not sure what they mean by supplements .   Supplements like different types of features buttons , like can have a f mute button or a swapping button .         Recogniser .   Okay , so why don't we put down speech recognition if possible pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is .     Uh our next meeting will be in thirty minutes , and the uh I_D_ is to this is the individual actions to be taken until then , to have the look and feel design , and uh the U_I_D_ is supposed to uh come up with the user interface design , and the marketing expert with the product evaluation . In this phase , the two of you , Jana and Francine , have to work together on a prototype using modelling clay , it says here . You will receive specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches . Um if you have any questions , you know , you you can always uh contact me um or uh or your coach , I suppose .
