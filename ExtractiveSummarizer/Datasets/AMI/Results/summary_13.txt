So uh good morning . I see you all find your places .         First I will introduce myself . I don't know if uh if everybody knows me , so I'm Bart , hello .   Bart .     Bart .   My name's Frank . 
 Thank you . Uh let's start off um with a little presentation . Uh Now first I'll tell you a little bit about the setting . Uh there are also some microphones there but th um you don't have to pay a lot of attention on those , because it will uh disappear when you don't attend to it . There are some notes in it already I see , some documents .  Well I don't know if you've noticed , but uh we're working for Real Reaction . I'm Bart the project manager Uh we have our opening acquaintance , tool training , project plan description closing .  Uh maybe I can sit down , then I can take some notes or Let's see . Maybe you can take the minutes once in a while .           I think I found one . Sure . Can't say I paid much attention to it , but I can 
 see if it works this way .       uh there was Real Remote instead of Real Reaction .       It has to be original , trendy , and user friendly . So these are uh the points why uh we also hired you . We've got the Marketing Expert for uh the trendy and user friendly look . And Industrial Designer uh there's also user friendly and a bit original .     Uh project method um is uh there are three phases we are going through . First is functional des uh design , individual work , meetings .     
 But I think you know it already by yourself . And the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirement specification , trend watching and project uh product ev evaluation . So that's a bit what you're going to do . But that will be all worked out in uh other meetings . it's handy if we have a little bit of training first . As you can see we've got the smart boards here and here in the white board . You can save . N uh these functions we don't have anything to do with , only undo , you can undo a little Uh then we've got our pen . It's really funny because you can draw with it on this page um in the think it is form of . You can also select the current colour and the line width . But we're going to work with it in a minute . a short thing about documents .   Project documents I think . But all you will found that already because there are a lot of documents in it already , so it will be okay .     It's what I just said , it's save , print , move back or forward one page .   So as you can see we g all going to draw a animal .   Mouse wasn't running away . That was interesting . 
 Is everybody is anybody playing with the mouse ? We're going to uh draw animal . Um the only thing we have to uh look after is that we use different colours , and different line width . Uh there's I can start from now . Another thing is you have to be uh a bit slow . 'Cause if you're going to draw like really fast then um the pen won't hold up . Then the line width . Now you'll see my drawing capabilities . These are not very much , but uh Yeah , he hasn't got an eye . Woah . Now we've got another function . We've got the eraser .       
  They've got no text tool , no .     Maybe you have to hold it a bit upside-down . I think that's it because if you wan ar are going to do it like this then it will be a stripe .     Maybe you have to use   I think it's a it wants to draw a another animal ?       
  Thank you . Gonna use a different line width . And I'm gonna draw in black . Kay , I'm not much of an artist , but here we go .     A sheep . Sheep .     little blue dot they always get sprayed on their butts . It's a real dead sheep , yeah . For recognition , yeah , I see . Um maybe you can also write your name somewhere . On just a 'Kay .     
 They're brilliant animal animals .               Garfield .     Um , you say a blank , or Yeah , just a blank sheet . Well I was gonna draw a cat too , so . I'll just try something else . Something different than Garfield .   No . Mine is a bit more skinny .   And the most interesting tail . 
   Well , it's supposed to be a cat . So everybody knows how to work with the white board now ? So if you have any ideas or if you wanna draw anything on the white board , just ask and go ahead . It's pretty uh easy . 'Kay . S haunted white board . Um as you can see , we um for our remote control , a selling price is uh twenty five Euros . Uh our profit aim is fifty million Euros .  Our production cost um can be maximal twelve and a half Euros , so that's also a point we have to keep in mind , that we won't make remote controls with small televisions inside , and stuff like that . So just try to remember these points .           Okay , that's uh good timing .     So just on a side note , why is it my laptop is only giving me a black screen ? Uh maybe you have to say the magic word .     No slide show .       Well it's those laptops .   But so mm does everybody has um experiences with uh remote controls , and I mean not the ordinary mote controls , but also a little bit different ones ? Like you can use for other ?     
 kind of broad T_V_ at home , and a D_V_D_ player And I think it's it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all . Yeah I've I've got one at home . I think eight different devices in it , and you can use it for your television , anything else . So that's pretty handy when you have a video recorder or D_V_D_ player downstairs Oh really . Mm-hmm . thing . I think that if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control , it makes it a lot easier as well .         So we've we want different functions Since it's your job . uh and we can maybe see if we can do something with the infra-red .     But that would be really good if we could do that .           my remote control tends to fall a lot . Waterproof , or uh   Uh , you never no know uh , w I mean uh Waterproof .     'Kay . Yeah , one other little thing . Thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it .     how much is left in the battery . But they'll also really drag up the production costs , so think we'll have to see about that too .                 
  Okay , then I'll put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder , and then we can all work . Finish meeting now . And we can all work uh on our own projects .
