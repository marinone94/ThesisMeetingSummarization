Who starts ? Alright , great . I've put some uh new things in the in the map .   Ah F_ five .   And you also ha all three of you have uh prepared something about it .     Uh then we'll uh look at uh the three uh presentations uh from you . 'Kay . I think you have prepared uh all three uh ? Um we'll look at th the new project requirements we uh I dunno .     You're the only one . Oh I've received a mail with uh some additional requirements , and I'll have a look if Well I think we should show them before your presentations , because it's not really uh   
 smart uh to uh to include some things uh we can't , because of the new requirements . And then uh we can discuss uh some more closely .         Um now I'll look at show this board . Um Well uh notes , first meeting . I gave a disc a a presentation . Uh we familiarised ourself with the boards and then we discussed some first ideas .   
 Uh not too many one buttons . One recognisable button in the middle , where you do the most important functions with . And um well they can have two functions , because uh you have a D_V_D_ and a television . Huh ? Um the design has to fit the hand , be original , but also be familiar . It's uh one of our ideas . Yeah well that wa It's just thirty minutes ago , so it's not quite uh   The materials uh well should be hard plastic with rubber from , and uh well the labelling of the buttons should be indestructible .           And uh the technical aspects um And also labelling of the buttons , the functions should be universal standards . Well that's just uh some ideas from the first meeting . It's quite logical al all of it .                the second is a bit sh pity because we just said we wanted to d include the D_V_D_       Oh , that's a shame . 
 So that's a shame , because uh especially for the third requirement we want to reach people under the thirty years .         Well and uh our corporate image should stay rec recognisable in our products . So uh we have to uh use uh maybe a slogan , maybe a colour , and um Yeah well uh on our remote controls the design has to be uh , well as we already said a actually , uh familiar .   
       the I didn't know what company we were , but we we design uh especially trendy uh trendy trendy stuff . So it has to be uh a modern design .     I uh noted uh our uh slogan that we have , our company . It's uh we mm put the fashion in electronics .   
   Alright then um we're going to uh have three presentations .           Oh no , no problem .   The order ? Well uh I think it's this one . But I'm not sure . You already uh opened uh PowerPoint . Right . Yes . Well , I'm going to tell you something about functional requirements . Um to start with these points . Uh next sheet ? 
 Um at first I tell you something about what people dislike about the current uh controls , because it's uh a smart thing to exclude those things . That's seventy five per cent of the current users . They don't like it , so we might think about fronts in that section . So it's very important that you design a a nice looking control . Um the current user uses his machine just about well all of the time for a few functions . So it's really important to make the the buttons for the common uh tasks kind of big or kind of uh flashy . So it might be sensible to make some kind of a button on your television , that's your um your control beeps or something , that you can find this very easily . I dunno , maybe that's an idea . 'Cause it's uh a big I think fifty per cent of the users loses his its control , within the same room . Well Oh .       but what if you lose your click-on device ?   Nee but it it specifically says it's uh the the control is lost in the same room . Well a beeping device would be Uh furthermore the learning time is a problem . Uh thirty four thirty four per cent um thinks it's   So the the learning curve should be very short uh for the dumbest people should be able to use it . Well we'll have a look at it , yeah . 
 I think our uh user uh expert should also consider manual a manual for the remote , of course .       users to uh add one ?     
 I think you should put more time in the in the design of uh pick up and use , than a manual .       Yes you should You should could take a look at it and and and know how it how it's supposed to work .       And it should be consistent with consistent with older remotes . Yeah but nobody reads a manual about a remote control , I think . Well maybe for the If you don't recognise a button who d who d who do I call uh wh when I don't know it ?           
 So it's better to uh put our attention to the the design .           Um R_S_I_ . Well that's about twenty per cent I thought . But uh the designer should uh take it uh should uh Wie zeg ik dat ? Yeah , consider the consequences of using your remote . It should be a good in your hand . 
 Yep .     said , we're gonna specify of we're gonna target a younger audience . Um , that's about sixty per cent of the market , so it's uh quite important . Um research shows that they like to have a little L_C_D_ screen on their on their uh zapping uh device .   
 So it's very important we should definitely have that in our uh designs .   Well with twelve Euro fifty as production cost , we can't uh afford an L_C_D_ uh     If we make lots of uh of the stuff , maybe we can uh buy it very cheap , I dunno .     uh Nigh I know . 
 We'll think abo we'll think             They also like that , but research is very uh costly . I think that's uh difficult to realise also . it it might be important for the sale .   It's not yet a standard uh development uh those so No and we have customers in multiple uh countries I think . Well I do think L_C_D_ is more reachable than the speech recognition . So we might consider L_C_D_ screens .         We don't rule them out uh yet .     'Kay .         to u uh to take this take these points into the notes .             Shall I give a technical talk ?         Well uh it is my task to uh explain uh or to point out a working design .   Okay , how do you enlarge it , so that you can have the F_ F_ five . F_ five . F_ five . 
 Yep . Well , the working design , that's my uh Well alright uh , you know who I am and what I do . Um well um I think it's important uh for you to realise the basic function of a remote control . Uh well you can see uh Oh right . A bit . Well , you can read it , it's not too difficult . You have uh basically uh the energy , the power of the of the remote control , uh and the sender , w which is the LED , the the the the the the the the the bulb that sends the the infrared beam to the , no , to the set . Uh the user interface is um uh the the the buttons of course . that's the basic idea . Um well I have uh uh put it in a in in in a a couple of basic steps .           The chip uh produces Morse code , um a specific code to indicate that specific button that is pressed , of course .     Ah bu Yeah , but we don't . Exactly . Uh well this is uh the basic uh function of a remote . I've some couple of pictures here . It's a very basic one . And uh if we if we're going to add an uh an uh L_C_D_ screen to it , it uh won't look anything like this , but This is very basic uh basically the the shape of um of a remote control . It has uh very little buttons and it's quite um Yeah , you can easily recognise the buttons . They're uh far enough apart and an anything . 
 uh not very high-tech uh indeed , and it's not very user-friendly .         Um I have a table here about uh the l the relevance of the buttons . Uh the power button is used very much , channel selection , volume and teletext . Well teletext is not an option , so that uh But I think it's very important to make um the power , channel and volume buttons uh near to the thumb , so you can't have R_S_I_ uh consequences .   Well but but if you have um the most used buttons all in one place , and you keep making the same um well moves .   
 You can also like Right .         That's right . That's right . 
 Well you you can't have any uh every button under the thumb , of course .       reject R_ R_S_I_ R_S_I_ . Maybe you can make , for for channel changing , two little buttons on the side of the remote , so you can just do like this . Like some uh little uh Gameboy things or some Yes I've saw that on m on mi mobile telephones they also have uh those buttons .                     he he touches the side   That's very irritating , I think .           Right , continue .   But in e in any case the the basic function should be uh indeed , and as you say at the thumb . I think that's a good idea , and uh and that the less important uh buttons , like the the the different channels , uh the numbers one two three four five as well , should be uh     Well it's uh pretty pretty basically uh as you said . And I have some pictures of the inside workings , but uh I don't want to get too technical , because uh that's not uh very uh useful for you .       So yeah exactly this is uh how it uh looks from the inside .       Oh I had to delete this , but I had to make a schematic uh of the of the new       
 Well we understand . Oh right , no . I think it's That's the most important thing .       Uh Then uh Mike can uh give the third presentation . How late is did we start his presentation uh ?       About twenty minutes ago ?     so But we do have to come to a decision , right later on .     Well I thought um everybody on the website uh would see the same thing , but 
 Yeah , uh there are different uh We have all have different home pages , with different links .     For instance you couldn't see this .   Well I'm Mike , User Interface Designer .     I used my own experience with remotes , took a good l look uh at the remotes on the corporate website , which are these two .   Yes , these are from from another uh manufacturer .   This one is engineering-centred , so this one has the most functions and um things . This one is user-centred .         Well , I thought uh that we uh reduce the the option to control the D_V_D_ also , and teletext and that kind of stuff . Uh so I thought we we we would use more or need more buttons than this one . But we have to reject that , because of the requirements ?   Th that's why this mm is not relevant any more                         Well absolutely , but i th they all have to have something about um the recognition from our company .       
 uh look at is the front . Or you can you can can put the same symbol on on every remote . So l like Ericsson does every uh We must have that . We can put it on the on the back side .       We can make a symbol of the company right here . And if you put a front on it , there's a hole on the front .   Yeah , so that you don't replace the symbol , yeah .   
 Or the th the the lowest part of the remote isn't changed by the front .           I think this is about the maximum number of buttons we need .   Like eject we don't need , and some other buttons we don't need .   
 Mike , uh can you put uh that picture from me on the in the Word documents file ? In Map ?               Um there are two target audi audiences , and we've uh chose for the younger one .                 Well what if we um I at I at home have a remote that has um the most familiar uh buttons on the top , and the bottom side of the front has a little clip , a f a little uh You can click away and then you have f much more functions that most people don't use but s some do do . I think uh the most functions uh underneath that uh uh No um mm usually Clip aren't used much .       Like L_C_D_ screens and voice recognition .     The newest features are , like I said , are uh L_C_D_ and uh speech uh control . 
 Our audience , these people , are very like these uh features .   So we must build in something , or they will to uh go to the concurrent .             L_C_D_ th that you can click on or something , or that you can click uh out uh of the remote . And if if that's gives you a little bit of sta status information .               And uh well if y if your remote picks that up also , you they can display which programme you're currently watching . So it it just signals the the different uh sig uh the different symbols on the screen you have , uh because if you change to s channel two you have two on the screen and two on your on your um on your L_C_D_ screen .   It it could be such a little uh th that you can click in and out and you and you have it . But should it uh really be uh clickable , uh or or just integrate inside to try to make it d more trendy .                 Yeah , something like on um some radios in car .       But that's of course uh a bit more uh expensive than uh the basic uh calculator design , with the scrolling text and that kind of thing . Wa Yeah . Well it's just one script .   It just means it's a script that's uh keeps it uh rolling , and it's not uh That's five minutes off uh implementing time I think uh Yeah , five minutes of ja ja for programming .     Alright , we go with the L_C_D_ screen ?     Kay .             Uh we can put some um decisions about um the controls we want , th the issue .                 So we want to have a small L_C_D_ screen that's special . 
 Shouldn't we start with the most important parts ? The L_C_D_ screen alright                 Yeah but with with the L_C_D_ screen on the top it gets a bit unnatural . 'Cause most remotes have some space left at the bottom . That thing is terrible .     We'll draw two , and then we'll see uh Maybe we should uh centralise the discussion here .     He thinks it's better to put the L_C_D_ at the bottom , and I think it's better at the top .       
 Well Uh well because most uh remotes have um some space left at the bottom , and that way you can keep the shape recognisable for everybody . But you just can put uh the the the the the whole interface a bit down , so that there's room for the for the interface . The the ticker The L_C_D_ is like like small .         Well I th I think Mike Mike has a point , because um when when uh when I use a remote l I hate the buttons but buttons at the at the bottom . and I I like to use the ones       So when I u when I have to have an L_C_D_ s scr window   Well that's a bit exaggerated .                     Yeah w well , but uh you don't have to throw uh um important aspe important aspect like familiarity uh completely away , uh because I think it's uh Yea Maybe a bic uh better uh white uh We White ?   Width .     Line width ? Width ? 
 Th that's not a problem .             A little a little bit . It it needs to be calibrated again .         You e you only have one pen for that screen . Alright , we have to make a decision now , because we don't have much time . Um It's special pen . I think we have uh a few functions , and we can put uh the L_C_D_ above it , and still have lots of room at the bottom , where you can put your hand .                 I totally agree .   The L_C_D_ .   We are two uh V_S_ two . Well but uh what what if we we first decide the different functions , and then look at the design .           Uh yeah we should uh summon the the different uh aspects of the thing .   And moreover I think that you two should be uh come to consensus about the L_C_D_ s .                           L_C_D_ window , the number buttons Alright , let's keep it central . 
       Volume control .   Uh the mute button . I h love that one . Well let's look at your uh design .       Yeah , in circle , you know ?           But th th on this remote th these controls are for something else , a D_V_D_ player or something . Well h ho   
       You should put that uh power button , channel and volume should have the most uh importance . I think these should be in one big circle in the middle .   
 When when you uh put them all in the same place , the most used buttons , you're doing the same thing all the time , and that's just what R_S_I_'s all about .       And they get less uh complaints of R_S_I_ . Yeah , it's it's also not good to completely stay in one position constantly with one hand . It's good to move uh from time to time .       No but now y W would we have to choose a     Um channels are uh most uh is most used within the hour .         Volume hardly .               Nei not too much , but The other the other two uh frustrations are far more important . I think you can have the two buttons of up and down close together , but you don't have uh have to have volume control and and zapping button close together . 
 Well for example the power button , you can If someone is constantly z zapping , it's not going to miss , that it that the power button is not right beside it .       Well they are used four times an hour , Nei nei nei n             Oh man , five minutes . Yeah , well five minutes left .     
 The most important things we have to uh C c can you make you make We can use uh the drawing board now , I think .       Just uh you decide that , you decide that , and ready .   Yes . Alright . Yes . Well the L_C_D_ . Um you are Industrial , you are User Interface . So I think it's going to go to Mike . But you will have to make consensus with . Well Well consensus , um We we can put it in the middle , so 
 Well it's a bit hard , because we are going to be uh individually .   Nei .         it's quite important though to uh to have it at the top ,     Well what if we're going to now decide about the functions , and the design comes into the next round ? 
 Well yes , that's alright . Are we going to uh do it like uh on Mike's screen with uh one button that says I'm going to do a t two number digital ? one two three four   six seven eight nine zero . Well just when you push a one one and       Yes .   Th that's the most That that's very easy . Alright so no button for that . Okay uh anyone any uh oth other functionalities of our uh remote ?     
 You do need the uh multi Or did uh No , like this one . You do need them ? Yeah , I know .     Well uh 
 Um well because we can't integrate it with any other uh remotes , all those buttons on those pictures are uh irrelevant .       Yeah , it's most useable this way .     So all those buttons that ar are to do with teletext Oh screen placing .   And uh the two important ones we're l f forgetting .   You can make it wider and less wide .     I do think we have to put that underneath a clip .   Those two ? But it's just two , and we make a clip ? Uh just two just two under uh under uh Th that's a bit uh waste . We we can make make uh a little row of like four buttons down here .         Your L_C_D_ screen is going to go .   But you you can put uh two or three buttons under uh another section .                 Well I think they should in an in an isolated part of the remote .     
 Yes ?       Well if you you take those th   Go to video , that's always on your remote control .       you can zap t you can you can zap to the video channel from zero to uh 
   That's just zero .     zero is a different channel than uh the the video channel .   Yeah , but when you zap down zero you get to A_V_ .   Yes , I think th       I think go to video is Ah uh well whatever , . 
 an irrelevant button , but and you want to uh go immediately to the video channel , you do you have to push a to to get below zero . Yeah , I I think that one button is uh I use it uh     Right all th these uh different buttons you have to       you have screen width . It's it's incorporated with p m plus and down , uh those     you have one one button from s set frequency o or something , and then with plus and min minus     That's the only one we put uh in there . So we still have one uh four ? For a screen uh fu uh channel setting . Yeah to uh oh yeah of course to configure the programme the Yeah .       Menu button .   And and the settings to change the brightness the settings to change the brightness and the contrast .       
 Chief ?   Th the menu menu button is also important .       I think things like uh contrast and brightness should be um in the menu , yeah . 
 In the menu . And you can uh then adjust it with the zapping buttons or something .           We're going to uh go to our uh rooms , and uh we'll have to decide s things on our own I think .   Yes chief .   I thought we'd uh lunch uh right now , or not ? Well see you uh W w we have lunchtime , by the way , now uh so uh Yeah , lunch break .
