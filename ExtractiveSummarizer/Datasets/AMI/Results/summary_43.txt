Good afternoon . Uh Uh , let me see . Our fourth and last meeting . In this meeting we will discuss our final design . And then we're going to close the project today as well . We'll have the prototype presentation first . Then we will set up some evaluation cri um criteria . Uh we will have to see if everything we wanna do is also possible within our budget . So we have to see if it fits within the twelve and a half Euro per remote . Then we will do the project uh evaluation , and the closing after that .     But first um we will do the this is prototype presentation . So , if some yeah if somebody wants step forward . Well this is what me and Richard came up with . The default spot for the on-off button .   Then there's the volume and channel selectors .     If you hold it and you press another button , uh the help goes to the L_C_D_ screen . Then there's the zero to one to zero buttons .         Sure uh just pop in at any time .   Uh , that's just uh the normal uh as th as the normal uh remote controls uh So um You put it uh you um came in uh page uh one hundred . Now you can use the normal uh one to zero buttons .   S so uh the shifting uh button . Uh for uh yeah shif shifting up in uh on t on t uh teletext , and shifting uh down .   
 Uh just a few buttons and large buttons .     So I'm wondering if we if we neely really need all of those buttons .     And well the on-off button , it's it's a necessity . You can't drop that one .     The mute button could be replaced uh by pressing the volume-down button twice . So we could cancel that one . I think the help button really is necessary because there's no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does . Uh , or you can build in uh when you press uh one button uh uh We disc discuss that already .       
 leave out the number buttons I guess .           If you just make a control for just the T_V_ there's just not much to gain here .     It's rather hard to draw on the white-board . But they're supposed to be equal sized , round , with a with a little logo on it for the for the volume , the the triangle and stuff .   Just n normal plain buttons .   Kay . and now we don't need uh LEDs or     So and for the materials we've just chosen for rubber buttons . With a a different colour than the case .       That's nice . Then because we only have thirty minutes left , I will move on to the finance part , which is pretty exciting , to see if it's all possible what we wanna do .     
 But maybe we can also use one . I don't know if it's possible . That's right . to save there . I don't know , but I think the single curved is good for design , and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control . Yes . It's the cheapest one we need . But then the biggest costs are the buttons . Because you have to we will have to get the twelve and a half Euros at the end . so if we Let's fir first count the buttons we have now . Uh seventeen .   Okay , including the help ? Uh seventeen . I think we can uh discard the help and the mute button         That saves us uh one Euro already . 'Cause then we have got fifteen I think ?   
 That wouldn't be an option . Fifteen buttons .   No those are one , I think . Well , think actually there're two buttons , aren't they ? Where did uh Uh , it's just one button . There were uh two uh for one big button .     So maybe we can we can even make one button with the volume and the channel in one , by pressing Well I was thinking , maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button .             But I don't don't know if if it's cheaper . So uh , we've still got four buttons , but just um So Uh s yeah channel .       
 Yeah on the chip there . On the chip you've got still uh four uh four buttons .     But , I think this really is four buttons anyhow . 
 Maybe it is , but then it seems to me that it's impossible to get the twelve and a half Euros .           Only the docking station , I guess . Which isn't the the docking station isn't even in this         Poland .   Polish supplier . Don't you think we can , if we can count this as v as one button , and integrate th uh these buttons in three , then we save a lot of money as well . 
 But would it make the remote more usable for elderly people ?   My mother can't even send send an S_M_S_ message .     We m uh we must um stay below the um below um twelve uh fifty     indicated that older people spend their money easier , more easy , maybe it's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little . Especially since we have those nice features .     We don't have any more budget to develop it . The margin will get too small .   
 But it is possible to make one uh for uh twelve fifty .       It would be a be a pretty rigid one .   Ten .             attractive uh o options .   I think it's uh difficult as well , but Or b Basically becoming a choice between like either a good remote and a higher production cost , or just any other remote control . 
 Or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers .     Then we have five and one .   If we have this one and we've got the advanced No , it     
 But how does scroll-wheel work here ?     If you scroll you will see the numbers on the L_C_D_ display .   That would bring up the price of the scroll-wheel also . 
 Alright .     Integrated scroll-wheel push-button .     So if you scroll to a number and then you wait a half second , then it g turns to that channel .     But it would definitely crop cost , a lot .     Yeah , but And the regular chip is not possible ?   If you want to use an L_C_D_ screen you you need an advanced chip , yes .     That's an option we can Then we're almost there .     Yeah if you v could just leave out one more button . Yeah , or we have to uh skip the subtitle uh button .     Can we use can't we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button ?     But the subtitles stay there . If you push it three times ?         One m uh one b uh , a few buttons .   Well , that could be just uh like the scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click .       remote with which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero .  With only five buttons on it .   I think if you make a good advertisement uh on television and in the in the guide , you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel . If you just make it real simple .   And we can keep our L_C_D_ screen , which can provide extra information .   How to use the other bu buttons as subtitles .             Looks a bit odd maybe .       One , two , three , four , five buttons , if we erase this one . And these are two buttons then . We could make two buttons out of that . 
 If you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll-wheel . So that would save two buttons .         So we make one for the volume , one for the channel .     So we've got one , two , three .   So this is five buttons .   And make it smaller overall .       decrease this one to four buttons . But uh , you can make a f quite a big uh remote remote control for uh just the same price as a small one . Just uh you only have to pay for the double curved or single curved . 
 It uh it's a bit uh   It's uh it's more the moulds in which they are being made , I think . Single curved is really easy to just fill in . And cases come right out of the machine . And single curved you have to have a different uh different machine , than a flat one . I think this is a really easy one .   Freek , what do you think ?   Richard's argument was very good .   We have to cut costs .       get us to spend eighteen dollars a a remote . I am agreeing with the usability .   But th um I think we can then keep the single curved one . Just to express our L_C_D_ screen a bit more .       
 So this is scroll .   Before we went on to the to the whole design .         It's pretty different , if you saw the last one than this one .     This will really require a lot of marketing to get this to sell . 'Cause if older people like familiar forms and familiar stuff .     So we're gonna have to do a lotta convincing them .     Uh they cal also uh buttons like that for uh changing uh channels .     
 We can let l We can stick it out , a bit . Maybe that's recognisable for them as well . That's a good one . If they see this design they think They'd be like , what ? Only five buttons ? That's right . What it costs under twelve and a half Euros ? Uh , yes they are . We still have fifteen minutes left , so we're nice on schedule . So um , I like set up all these criteria .   Evaluation criteria .   That was the the point I forgot .   Evaluation criteria . Go ahead . We've got five minutes I think for those criteria . No we've got fifteen minutes but    Five more minutes ?   'Kay so I did some literature study study , and analysis of the requirements we set up earlier . Translated it into criteria , which would be these .   The shape , look and feel .             And are the those functions that are there , are they useful ?   The target group .               Yeah , that's because my pen failed to upload his data .   but it's uh it's giving errors by downloading the software .   Kay . 
 Is the design fancy , on a scale of one to seven ?   Six .   We all go for six ?   Six .   
     So we've got twenty cents for our docking station , huh ?   I think so , with our L_C_D_ screen , docking station , scroll-buttons .                   I would say four . Four or five between . Between four or five . Four or five .     I'd go for four , too .     
 Um , do we have all functions that we want to include ?         It's pretty slim . Think it's uh seven . Seven .   take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control ?       Mm , we haven't thought of that one .   They are ugly , not very functional , and getting lost . Are the production costs within the preset limits ?     I think that's a three .                     I think a radio button is not exactly what older people expect to have a remote control .   I would give it a four .   I think I'd go for two . I go for three . Then we have to do the three . It's the 'Kay .       
 And they wanna put fashion in their products . So , I think it's very recognisable . I was also supposed to calculate the score , but               These are seven factors times seven is forty something . Two ? No . Nine ? Forty nine . Uh , minus one . Minus three , minus four . Minus four .   Forty one out of forty nine . 
 Forty one .     That's eighty four percent . I think that's a pretty nice score . Kay .     So , that brings us to the project evaluation .   
 Thank you . Project process .       Think we should have a should have had the finance thingy a lot earlier .   In the design phase . So lack of information about prices .       Was there room for creativity ? It's because of the finance sheet .   Yeah , there w there was enough room , but the finance uh       younger users also .   get something of your own .   
 Internet access . 'Kay .   Was it clear what everybody had to do uh according to their roles and functions ?   
 Teamwork ?   Working together ? Also , you two of you with the uh last phase ?   Nice .         Well , the smart-board , the d d drawing is just a pain in the ass , but   The digital the digital pen is very nice .       So you rather wanted to have a flip-over ? Or something else ? A flip-over or a more precise uh Yeah . A flipper's uh easier , so     
   Flip-over . But if you want to share uh of uh when you make um a picture like this uh on the presentation , it's easier to uh share it with uh other people . Uh so uh you can sh save it uh and uh put it on the internet , or uh uh in shared f uh folder or uh sh uh shared directory . Yeah , I tried to open the file on my laptop , but                   
 So the sharing of the information was uh was okay ?       Yeah , pen is here on the table .   That's nice . Have we found new ideas for having this kind of meetings ?   Uh uh o one of uh out of s uh   Um it's uh easier to uh to do the th things that are like that on a computer . Uh , so uh just l uh like uh at u university uh   And then it mediates the score , and you can get one         Or questions about the project ?       Considering we are not going to make a docking station . Docking station .   But maybe because of the docking station the price of the remote can also be a little bit higher ?       
 Do we think we gonna get the twelve and a half million ? Especially in America . People are pretty decadent . Yeah , still I think I mean if we're n gonna make a scroll-button anyway Just put it on the market for everybody . That's one thing you can change it with . Just as a test . See how it works . That's true . Yeah , I think then it would be way more uh popular with younger people than it is , than would be with   Even if it were their covers .     I think we still have to fit in one more questionnaire .         'Kay .   Oh I think I have one now . Five more minutes ? Oh that's nice .   
   Then we still have some questions . If somebody has some questions they can ask them now .     Export as picture , I think . This is another network , I guess .       Uh maybe uh they will save it . Yeah , I'll just put it in My Documents and uh That's okay .       And then I will be back in about ten minutes to show you the final presentation . Summary of the project . Are we supposed to go into our own rooms again ? Uh maybe we have to fill uh another questionnaire .
