Uh fourth meeting . Alri alright . I'll show you the notes again .   Well you'll you two will uh present us your prototype .     I'll show you how we're going to do with financing this uh design . 
 Bit late .           Well the finance uh we'll do later , so um firstly uh I'll show you the notes .     Oh nei .         It's a nice chorus , yeah .       We ge we went through the agenda , and well we had some uh some presentations from you three . And uh I summarised what you said to us .         It's also copy paste from what we made together . So we still know that .   Well uh next you two will uh present uh the pot prototype for us . 
 Alright .   Alright . If I make mistakes uh you'll uh supplement you .       Uh it's pretty uh much uh like uh Mike draw uh drew uh the in the during the last meeting . With uh the different uh perspectives of it . Uh we'll begin uh with the front .   
 Um with uh the upper part being the front . Th And uh we're we're using different colours .         Mm-hmm . of the of the device . Uh which is of course um part of the back actually , because it's also titanium . You can see it also on the on the on the side view , that only this part is the front , and the rest of it , the under uh the under side uh of it , the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium , and has the titanium colour of course , the look . Um then we have uh on back on the front uh the logo in the upper corner , uh which is uh made uh which is also part of the back , part of the titanium uh titanium part . 
 It's a double R_ . Um so that's the logo in the upper lef uh right corner . I think oval will be better for the for the d for the different uh channel buttons . Um um with kind of arrow shapes , which makes it also a bit more exciting than basic round or um uh Oh nei we uh the Okay button's here in the middle of the of the operators , of the channel and uh volume um changers . Alright . And the video button . And of course this low part , this is the L_C_D_ screen .       
 Well if I look at it , the side the side view but n I'll uh finish this uh quick . Um okay I've had everything I guess on the front ? Yeah the back . We thought about           And the company slogan , we thought in a kind of arc shape uh above the logo .     This the front won't be as thick , but again th the the drawing technique makes it very difficult to to really uh Oh and uh before I forget . Yeah the the voice , of course , the voice recorder is uh at the bottom . And you can record it uh using , yeah , the the the back of the f w device .     
 When I look at uh when I look at this side view , I think w when I have that in my hand , it's terrible .           Well what what what I what I agree is that when uh when um you have such of uh an arc in the middle , so that the the a the ends and the   If you handle a remote , you you usually don't have your hand straight like this . You you have it a bit uh   If it's kinda small , this is is great . But if it's it's larger , then you want to grab it .   
 Yeah , that's the question .     What do you suggest I mean we do ? This was Mike's prototype , and y you seemed to agreed on it .   Well the sides I haven't seen yet , uh ?   
 The size ? Yeah well the size doesn't really matter w I mean     he drew the s the side , but you d you weren't paying attention as usual . Well any case , we'll discuss it now .     Yeah , I agree with the L_C_D_ screen . You have it in your palm like this , and you can watch uh watch the screen . And if you have it li in the middle , your hand might be over it .               Like you're holding your telephone .           And maybe you can you can grab it a bit higher , so         Well that's a reason to to to put the L_C_D_ screen uh of course on the upper side , but Well f for as far as I can see , three of us agree and only Nils Yeah well uh I think uh if you t if you three uh agree then then that's it .   
 Yes .       you said it was totally uh unusable . No , when I I my personal taste is that I want it to fall over my hands with a thick But But d you don't think this is completely unusable I guess .               y you are also human . We have to take uh every everyone into account .   Well uh who who else thinks like you ?   Maybe a thousand people , or a million people . 
 Yeah , we don't know , but that's uh that's that's that's more market research . So let it be like this at uh at this moment .         Comes to that later . Uh c You can uh Walter . You can do the evaluation uh criteria on this ?         
 I'm going to do uh the ev evaluation . I made a few questions on the hand of uh uh the impor most important requirements and trends . And we have to look if our uh if our device uh is working correctly .     'Kay .   I uh think you have all seen uh this kind of evaluation , so uh I don't have to explain it . Uh the first question is , uh is the device good-looking ?   Seventy five percent of them .     Yeah , we're we're not quite uh objective about this .   So I have to take this questionnaire .     To potential customers who have to take this questionnaire ? Nei . 
 But um Well we can go , uh because of the time , uh pretty quick through this . Uh do we find it good-looking ? Yeah , I think it di we designed it to be perfect . And I have to uh take all these points and get a average at the end .       Well l well let's start with the beginning , just one by one .       it's um pointed towards the youth of course , uh if you look at the design and and the colours and everything .   But it's also not completely um Two . 
 uh u unacceptable for older people I guess .   Yeah , that's that's uh for older people , it's it's more that classical look . So for older people .       Uh I think it's also good for them , so I think we both uh have uh consider considered uh the youth and also a bit older people .     I think we shouldn't discuss any points points that long , because I don't know how how many points there are but uh Yeah , the fourteen yeah . Right , a number please .     So the last one is seven .   It's one . Oh , sorry .   
 Well uh two ?           The power , channel and volume buttons are easy accessible ? With two huge buttons . 
   Two . Two ?       We didn't implement anything about that . Well it's easier to find than a a normal black one or something , because of the colour . Well six then . Six ?       Well w I we do want we have a l f f less of an       Well , I should I think two , because the voice recorder is n not self learning . 
 Alright . Two ?       I think this is too time consuming .   Th this is Are we take too much time ? Right , R_ R_S_I_ sensitive ? 
 We you have to put it to the customers .   Uh well well a bit , so four . Four .    One . And features included also one . And One . Uh those uh nine uh is the fancy-looking .       
 And I think fancy-feeling too , because of the titanium back .     Yeah well also we have two .       So well maybe two because of the voice recorder . Well , with the uh Three . Two two . Two , three .     So yes , one .   One or two . One or two , another two . Nah f four   If you look at this Four ? Well , it doesn't really resemble any fruit , uh that's true .       Well three . Three , alright .       So I would say at least two .     
 This is the last meeting ?         There had to be some kind of trouble along the way .   Well , look at the costs at this point .     It has to go to twelve , right ? Twelve and a half . I twelve and a half . Well what costs a lot ? The sample spea costs four . The sample speaker , the s sensor .   
 We have to go to twelve and a half . The speaker . Then we go to fourteen point six . Well the titanium I don't want to lose actually . L_C_ three ? Y t come on , w a remote control has a battery .     Well be for the L_C_D_   the L_C_D_ screen .   Because uh that uh y because my information says it . Well what what's the difference between simple and regular ?   What's the difference between a simple and a regular chip ? Regular is normal .     I read something about it , but   
 Nothing .   Yeah , I I read something about it , but it wasn't very clear . d I didn't in include it in my report .         Well you have to use the advanced chip , if you have the L_C_D_ screen . How much do we win ? One .   But if you have a regular chip , you can't have the L_C_D_ screen .   Yeah , we need to have the the L_C_D_ screen .         Yeah , but it's only one half .   Yeah , then you s then you only have one half left .   You must change the chip back , Nils . But we d Then we have to lose the L_C_D_ screen .       I di I didn't uh put uh the advanced chip in there for fun .     
 You can make you can make it cheaper .   You you we have an advanced chip-on-print , and we have an L_C_ display .     No , the advanced chip is needed to have an L_C_D_ display . For the L_C_D_ screen .   Says , his Uh that was in the second meeting , I think .       Well you said s double curved , uh he , because uh I thought it's a b a bit cheaper already . We can also make it flat .     
 What do they mean with the curves ?     One curve ? Yeah , this is actually two curves ,         No , it's one curve . One curve . One curve , simple .   W t we can never get uh below the twelve and a half . We have a big financial problem .   Well , then we have two dollars less profit . Come on , if we if we if we make this fifty million , they won't hesitate to uh congratulate us , so uh If if you make people brand-aware , they are willing to pay more .   If you have uh lots of uh marketing   Yeah or we could replace it   By the way , we also have this one .           Hey but uh I think you'll agree that uh         Why why don't we replace the titanium with uh 
 That is pretty stupid .                 But then we we've got to uh run through the eval evaluation process again . Th then you have a ugly , stupid , l ugly looking , dumb remote that that no-one would buy .   The looks remain the same .     I think the titanium just uh provided the the tough look and the and the   And the feel , and th that it is strong , and   And also the the older people will like it because of that . And because i Alright it's not our target audience , but it's it's useful if it's uh important for old people .   We still we had to focus to get more people from the younger group , but not lose the one         But you can better , yeah , dump the L_C_D_ screen then .       I don't think you should dump the L_C_D_ screen .     
 Or you shou It's Or change the titanium or dump the L_C_D_ screen . Because you have lots of functions in it too . Yeah , well yeah . Alright . I agree with that . So we u we use uh   I'll put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the l m lowest price you can make a remote for that's trendy d these days .       I'll talk to the managers . W Titanium stays there . Titanium , I thi       Osl 
 So we have to use the ditch the titanium , I'm afraid .               but we don't really consider the costs .     If you don't have the money , you can't make it . So s If you don't have the money , you can't make it .       So One and a half Euros .       Yeah , but then we've got money left . And on plastic times two and then we uh are there ?       well Oh six .   No two for the to make it clear . It's just free , man . Four . But then we can add the special colour ? As we have money over uh left . And we still have money left . What do we want , guys ? I want gold plating .   I want chrome . Well I think uh the case is double curved then .                     Well y we have curves in all directions .     But it's pretty funny . We we do want to reach   
     I mean , this this ain't titanium , but it looks like it . We get more salary , if we make if cheaper than twelve uh twelve and a half . 
 Well , guys ? Guys ? We have to dump our titanium , and we'll hate the managers for that , but now we're going to evaluate our project , of uh project , project . I think it's terrible that we got uh those costs at the last moment . that's a reason , but also for our creativity . Well we we we used our creativity , but we just had to adapt it to the costs .     Nei .   
 Uh leadership next .           Well it's It was very democratic . well I think so also . 
 al I've uh filled that in in a the questionnaires uh each time , so Well the managers were terrible .       It's the requirements of the user , uh I guess .     we won't d uh we won't uh use teletext , uh we won't use the D_V_D_ .   
 Alright , teamwork ?         Uh well what do you , what did you think about the SMARTboard ?       No , that's a SMARTboard , and that's a digital pen .         That's the digital panel . I liked this SMARTboard , but I hated that one .   This this this isn't a SMARTboard , right ?         Oh they're both SMARTboards .   It's both a SMARTboard , but this one is used for a desktop , and that one is used to to draw .     And here , on this one , you can uh draw the pictures and things like that . Well , wi w which one did you like ?       That one isn't accurate .         Yeah , but I think there's a big distinction between the these th I don't need a SMARTboard .   We're now talking about the SMARTboards .     Well we we used that one , and we needed it .         Or install a laptop to a beamer , or have this one standing here in an I I like it .   
 Yeah I like that one , but that one is terrible .         And uh the digi the digital pen ? Did uh did you like that one ?     but I didn't import it into my laptop . I used it uh just to check it out , but uh You you can't send that to anyone , because you you've scrabbled something on a page for yourself , and then you're going to send it ,       And i you can also bring your your your note block .   what's the point of importing it into     Well I I drew this . And I made a mistake . But it it would have been uh useful , if I I could show this on the screen .   
 For drawings , but not for personal notes .         Uh I mean you can bring your paperwork along and p       But for notes , it i you you have to put that in a strict Uh you have to put a name , standard date , and all those things . And notes uh for a meeting are very strict . So if you uh were to write them down for yourself , and then put that in your computer , you still have to type it over to Word .   That Stefan use .   But I think uh d this option is only useful if you've got a lot of paperwork .   Yeah well a lot of documents are               Mu Yeah right .   
 Of course great .   Wireless uh wireless things . Thanks Project Manager .   I hated the cameras , I hated the microphones . Well these chairs , man .       I half of time   I haven't looked w one time directly at the camera .     Because this is a realistic environment .     Uh etcetera We N new ideas found ? What kind of ideas for n a future schedule For future um meetings you have got ?   Well I missed uh the option to uh       Email or chat or something .   that's just the the environment they set us up f with .     but that's one n new idea .             Digital pen is useless .       
 But uh two t       For people who uh sketch th the whole day , I can imagine that it's useful . Well th then still they should have a a nice graphics programme on the laptop .       Well you you can't you can't draw on a laptop like you like you paint of or draw with your hand .   With the mouse it is No .   Mouse is ju just isn't working if you're sketching . 
 Uh indeed . And but what if uh maybe this this board uh SMARTboard is malfunctioning or someone . But suppose it was working correctly , what uh would it be useful then , if it wasn't off all the time ?     You you can't draw anything uh neat . Yeah , but he's saying if it is correct , and you can draw very , yeah , very precise     I if it if it would be perfect following .       Yeah , mu but but then you can uh save it in instantly , and   
 it has It is useful .       So uh if we get in uh if we get another one and you make sure it does work , I think then it's pretty useful .     Because uh yeah you can draw t things quickly and uh clearly for anyone uh in the discussion room . And then you can save it immediately .               Yeah , we can go to the bar and uh with our newly earned money .     Um I don't know how long we still have . I dunno how long uh we had for this last meeting . Maybe till four o'clock or something ?         You better get started . I Di did you um save this one in the folder ?       
 But Nils you've got some work left . The folder , yeah .   Two times quick .           Oh great , man .   I'm gonna buy one buy one for my bedroom .
