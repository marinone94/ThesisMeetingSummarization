Because if we have as much time as the last uh meeting , we'll have to hurry up . Right . Uh This one I think . Well alright . It's not as uh interesting as it should be because we just uh had the meeting , but I'll show them . I've put a f uh a file in the project management folder , which says exactly uh what kind of decisions we should take . Alright , great . Well these are some examples , but we'll talk about them later .   Yo . Alright , Trendwatch . 'Kay .   I will speak about uh latest trends trends , latest fashion updates , and uh things we must not do .     'Kay . 
 That's uh something you uh have to take a look at . And uh the feeling has to be very great . Also the menus and things like that they have to they have to feel great . Alright . Um there's a minus uh two times here , because this is the most important point . This is uh two times as less important , and uh same for this one .     Uh such as an uh L_C_D_ screen , uh speech uh acknowledgement , as we uh talked about earlier .     Right . Uh the last point is easy to use .       
 I think that's your ta Well , easy to use uh s is a bit uh contradictionary with the first uh Functional     I think we have to go for the first one . It's the most important one .       
 Well something fancy looking can be can be easy to use .         Yeah , right . But the most important thing is that it looks great and people say wow , that's real great uh great concept .     So it must be very bright , very colourful .   'Kay . 
 So we we have to think uh in this direction . Fruit and vegetables are cool . Uh furthermore uh material , that's your part , should be very strong . I was thinking of something like uh well uh iron plate over it , maybe in a colour or something , that looks so f really flashy but Well the the handy thing about our fronts is that we can follow these trends e ev every year . Th this year it's fruits but next year it's       So it looks very heavy but you can still uh use it very easily .   Well , the don'ts .     So uh we're gonna turn that around . We're gonna have real uh cool shapes and lots of colours .   
 Wood is popular . Aha .   Yeah , among the old people , yeah . Old people . 
 Nice , uh well show us . And the materials ? Um I have heard several things , so uh I'll have to change that on the way . Uh I suggested uh in the previous meeting hard plastic .                 i is of course uh pretty pretty tough , but it doesn't have a really really tough look . But we still have to look at our price of course . Because uh if we want an L_C_D_ uh window etcetera uh   
 But we'll return to that .               Uh the target audience product style .   They also like straightforward shapes and luxurious style .       Um under forty five years old .   Yes . Soft materials is of course uh agai again a bit a contradiction with uh our uh material choice of what you said , that uh it should be hard an and and and and strong looking . But they like soft materials , uh so we might uh we have to consider that . also they like curved round shapes . So not uh too formal like like uh the older people want . And if uh also a finding but not very ap applicable here , that sports and gaming devices such as uh discmans for jogging and that those kind of devices , gaming devices , should define the characteristics of the device . 
 We keep coming back to the fronts . several examples of uh styles , so you can get a clear picture of uh what I mean . It was not very uh interesting uh , very classical looking , but that's n that's not what we want . We have these kind of things . I don't know what exactly they are . It looks like Fruity . And uh well round shapes , primary colours . You can see it all here . And of course uh this famous device . So to give you an idea of uh  Hmm ? Yeah , alright .     Although it's plastic , it's it's grey to to to give it iron look .     But then you are losing your fruity colours .   Well you can make th th th that middle ring can you you can make another colour . So uh those kind of things you can you can combine .   
 Well we can't really make a round uh a round remote control . I don't think that's very practical , but But uh it's important to to uh to think about the colour .     But this is plastic , and and this too , but No , it isn't . But it doesn't have to look strong .   The feel . The feel ? 
 Uh alright .     And it it doesn't have to be strong , also .       Maybe you should have uh some some coloured titanium or something . So it it looks pretty   
 Oh . Um uh about the energy energy source of the of the device , uh I uh suggest uh the basic battery . And uh kinetic and and and dynamos are are not very practical , I think , for uh for a simple remote , that's a bit , And I also suggest uh as a shape uh a double curved case . Uh the disadvantage of that that you can use no titanium . can't use titanium . Um yeah I think uh sort of triangle-shaped bottom or something . I'll draw it , but maybe later . Um anyway Yeah , well okay .   No uh otherwi uh no um difficult scroll things or some uh things like that , because it makes more complex and expensive .     But we do use an L_C_D_ screen , so we uh we do have to consider uh of we have to use a more advanced chip , which is more complex and expensive .     It's worth the trouble I think , because The buttons can be made of an uh a soft material .     Uh soft enough . So that's uh basically what I want to talk about .   
       And then uh Mike ? Well um nah the method um we will um include the buttons as we discussed uh earlier . Um an L_C_D_ s screen will be implemented . Um we must decide where , this meeting . Um there are new developments in speech recognition um systems , um and they are already being uh used on uh coffee machines .         
 the prerecorded message that you left . So if I say hi Mike , and you have recorded uh hi Mike back , then you will get that .         No it doesn't does not do anything .             But it has no functionality for our remote at all . but that's the gadget they want , or the gimmicks .   Young people love them .   They like gadgets . Yes , we we should really uh include that one , I think .     
 If it's cheap . Well , as I said uh earlier I think the uh L_C_D_ screen should be uh positioned at the lower end of the remote . Um the buttons for screen width and general settings and uh and that kind of stuff um we can also do let that kind of functions um be shown in the L_C_D_ screen , uh instead of uh extra buttons .     So you put a menu in the L_C_D_ ?   For the learnability and uh well to keep it recognisable .         I didn't tick the note bo box in the .     
   How do you uh uh give input to the menu on the L_C_D_ screen ?     So you have a menu button , and then you can go up and down . Well I will draw what I had drawn on the screen .       Um I shall draw this .     
 Just uh There is already a blank .         Because of the fruity uh fashion .                     This must be the Okay button used to uh interact with the L_C_D_ screen .   Um the video button should be uh an apart button , because you want it to uh t , yeah , to use it fast within one uh click .         This button can also be the Menu button , we use in the menus     Maybe I you could j just do an an exit with Okay . Uh by pe pressing the menu button again . By pressing the menu button again , you go uh out .   Yes , well but bec because when you push Menu you get in ,       But you can men you can press menu again to get out .   No no , we we we should uh add uh a extra Menu button and this the Okay button . Or you can put in the L_C_D_'s uh window an option Get Out .     Ah once you have an extra Menu button , you don't need that that extra option .     
       Why would you put it uh then , and where is the recording uh the microphone ?   Well they that could be anywhere .           But that's just a little gap . Right , and spea speaker at the back , or something .   Well the speaker and the microphone , I think , are the same uh little hole thingy .   Uh but uh we could uh d do , but it's perhaps more expensive , uh the speaker on the back or something .     Um there are a all already being implemented in in coffee machines , so they won't be uh very expensive .               And oh I think as you can see so , the L_C_D_ screen does look better uh at the lower end , or at the bottom .           Oh , um I had some uh examples .           quite obvious , very ugly remote . They do they don't look fruity enough . Nei   No , well th     Hey , that one I like . Uh this is for children but th         
 it's a bit the way we're going to .       But it it must not look too childish of course huh ?   Too many buttons .   This uh these are the L_C_D_ screens . I think we should , if it's um possible , uh one with colours , but Nah th   
       Well Nah .   Ha , even more .   But are we going for a strange uh form ? ' Kay .   'Cause people like that .     You can make the the underside , you can make it more round , where the L_C_D_ is .   
   Th a a kind of bridge .   I dunno if you know the No Nokia telephone , with uh the round uh thing at at the bottoms , s something like that . Well I have at home a remote with a bridge . It's just a half round half half circle at         
 Y yis     So we'll get to that later I guess .         Um conceptual phase , I think this is it . The specific shape . I got this from our friends .   
 Our sources . Um now from the user interface , your uh package ? Um where No well , that's more like the buttons where they have to come . Yes , but we have to decide about these now . So as you said , fruity is in , well sells good .   So we have to uh put it in one uh document .     Copy paste uh this story into a into a Word document , and then uh put the answers after the subjects .     Yeah but all these examples are uh of a coffee machine .         Well what do I suggest actually ? What what kind of properties should it have ? 
 Well we just listened .     yeah , some kind of metal for the uh the the whole remote except the front .   Just like um most cell phones are .       Yeah but the non-removable elements of the of the remote , so not the front , could be titanium , to give that uh strong look .   And you can put that on and off , and switch it .       Uh you have the best of both worlds .   Kay . Yeah , you have the re remote in your hand like this .       Fronts are are cheaper than when they're from plas   And I don't know if you can make steel just any way you want it to .       Uh titanium I sh             According to my sources , uh it's it's totally possible to make an entire uh uh uh Titanium is available , and uh we can uh make uh an entire remote out of it , if we want .   
     Yeah alright . So , we're going for a titanium back and a plastic front ? Alright . Yeah , I think that's a nice trade-off . Titanium back , plastic front . 
 Um well I am going to put it in here , uh because we can uh look .           But then you have the problem , when you have a titanium back , you can't switch it . When you want an other colour on the front , it doesn't match .   Well titanium is neutral . The titan titanium isn't isn't v very 
   No uh I nei .   but you know b Titanium is very basic colour , and it doesn't really matter if we have a purple front on it or a orange front . I dunno if if you disagree , but I think it's doesn't matter very much .     Hmm .               And well the the electrical cable is just normal uh . Cop copper uh material .       Yeah copper i just a ba basic uh No we don't use an electrical cable .   Yeah well inside the remote control we use a couple of uh   
 Yeah , but that's not what's meant here , I think . Oh external ? Well uh all the all the inside work of our remote is uh standard Right ? Uh the buttons are normal , etcetera . So that's just easy . The conceptual specification of the user interface ? Um well we have our beautiful drawing .   Well I got a better one here Well you can put that in uh into the shared folder , and then I'll put it in our end report .         Um the trend-watching included these days .           We can also uh implement um we can also implement fronts from um movies that are very hot .   Yeah that's the whole idea of the front . 
 Yes .         but if you if you launch uh five different packages like iPod mini     It's good marketing .   So e th then a c couple of basic colours .               when they buy it for the first time .   We still have to make those fifty million , yeah ? .     The most boring fronts possible . Well you can you can give them uh s s three or so , so that they can uh experiment with it and that they want more .     Two .   Red red , blue and green you give them or something , and then you can give them uh other ones .   
 Um well the buttons etcetera , we get from Mike .   well I think we'll have to in the next uh half an hour       But we we must remember that fancy look-and-feel is the most important thing . Else it w won't sell .     Well I'll have to , before I get another warning for five minutes , I'm going to get           
 Uh basic stuff . Interface we have . Supplements , L_C_D_ . Alright .         User Interface , Mike .   on a prototype drawing on the SMARTboard .     But bu we stay we stay here or something ?     Th they're saying SMARTboard and that's it You can take the SMARTboard .   And take it to our rooms and uh This is the SMARTboard , so Um so you can uh you you are going to make a prototype , and y   Ah , specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . 
 So you'll get it on your em on your laptop .       Kay . Some non functional tasks .     We don't have produ product yet , so kind of difficult .       Uh no I don't know anything , but maybe uh anyone else uh     Will we use uh round buttons or square ones for the for the numbers ?           And these uh these s these buttons uh are more uh triangle-ish shaped with a square one in the middle .         And this must be uh volume I think , and this programme .     Well most of the time uh up and down is programme and left and right are volume , I think . Well th th th th th       If you turn up the volume , you always see this thingy go up . We we j we'll just give them an uh We'll design it , and then they can give comments on it .     Ts It doesn't work any more . We can't save them . So we'll just have them uh standing there .     It's a bit uh bit a pity . Well we still have uh more than five minutes .     I as Project Manager ha don't have a clue .       
 Um I think um a logo , our company logo , and the slogan should be or could be           Too much text and it gets too too busy .     Well it's quite a long phrase . We put the fashion in electronics . We put the fashion in electronics . But we kree we keep adjusting to the fashion         Ah the logo should be on the top I think .   
 On the top . Well in in in the right top corner ?             But the logo the logo shouldn't be exchangeable , when you get off the front . Yeah it it should be hard on the on the on the board , and you can remove the front .     You can The logo can be on on every uh front . Yeah , but you can scratch it off or something .   Yeah , but then you must uh really uh yeah push it in or something . Carved into the material . No , you you can carve it into the titanium at the back .   But am I the only one , or uh         yeah , push that in , so that it is always be there .   The front side , no no l no slogan . No not on the front , but on the backside . 
 Sorry . I think it's a nice idea , to make it more recognisable , that the next to the logo you have the slogan .   To make more uh of an impression .       Not on the entire back , but uh just very small . But readable enough of course .   
 Lo Or maybe here in the middle , but we'll decide later .  changing fronts . Do you do you see a bit of the of the um Five minutes left .     Uh maybe if we make this this this lower part titanium , the front is the the upper part , and the the bit with the with the L_C_D_ screen .       But then you have two parts of front , two fronts that     No , they have two fronts , that .   This enti entire bottom ? Else you you get problems with the L_C_D_ .             
 but uh some sort of wave or something .   filth between the mobile .     Some some kind of wei weight in it . Round forms .     With the with the curved edge .   A bit like uh a bit like your mobile phone .   It also has the those two distinct uh Yeah .                 Yeah , that's nice finishing touch you need .   Yes , that also sounds uh pretty uh neat . So this this is the exchangeable part .     And it's only f twenty five Euros .       That's a bit too much , but No , no no no , but I think uh this looks uh pretty nice actually .   The Phillips remote uh costs more .     Taking all the credit . Well uh you two are going to work together .       We can't uh take a blank one .   Well we can uh erase an animal I guess . Uh the fourth one .   But don't erase my cat . Uh the fourth one is empty , isn't it ?   I want to preserve it . This one is empty . You have to empty one huh ? Oh , we have a one .       Yeah I think we have to wait ?   Yeah until the until the beep goes . But I don't uh Do we have to stay here , or I think we have to return first .           Because it's little bit uh hard to work with these uh plates . The high powers from above will have to tell us , yeah .             
 We can uh do a touch-pad on our remote . Well we have uh Yeah right . And in your remote control .     Aha . This has no function . Half But uh th youth doesn't care about functio functionality , so But they do want some gadgets .   
 It's all about cool things .           We've done too much in the previous meetings . Yes , we've got nothing to do now .   Well , that's not bad , is it ?     we agree I guess on uh several thing , on most uh on things . Its the best remote ever .     Oh he's totally off again .     
       Yes , but you you get really close to the screen with your hand , and I don't think that's       the green board with the , how do you call it , chalk , yeah . We can better uh draw a design on this .     Maybe if i if that thing is recalibrated , we can draw a thing quick , and then before it uh       Finish meeting now . Finish the meeting now .   We'll stay here ?       
 No , get away . Maybe w maybe we maybe w m Can we get email here ? Huh ? Guess so . Um I I'm not sure .
