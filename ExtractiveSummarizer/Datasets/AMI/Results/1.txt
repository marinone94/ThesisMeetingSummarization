 Am I supposed to be standing up there ? So we've got both of these clipped on ? She gonna answer me or not ?         
   Hello everybody . Um I'm Sarah , the Project Manager and this is our first meeting , surprisingly enough .  we will do some stuff , get to know each other a bit better to feel more comfortable with each other .   Um , we want it to be original , something that's uh people haven't thought of , that's not out in the shops , um , trendy , appealing to a wide market , but you know , not a hunk of metal , and user-friendly , grannies to kids , maybe even pooches should be able to use it .   what we're thinking , how it's gonna go and then the detailed design , how we're actually gonna put it into practice and make it work .     We're gonna practice with the pens and draw our favourite animal on the white board , I'll go first , and um sum up the characteristics of that animal .   Okay , I'll leave space for everyone else .     I'm not gonna ask you to guess , I'm going to tell you that's supposed to be a tiger .                             
   It's your best friend and your you can talk to a dog , it can be your best friend , it doesn't discriminate between you , based on what you are . Second it's loyal and third thing it's got intuition . dogs can som sometimes can make out between a thief and a person so basically these are the three unique features I think belong to a dog .       Please , please leave me a space at the bottom , I'm little , you can get to the top , with standing on a chair .         Okay , now I'm gonna have to change what is was originally gonna be because that looks like a beak now , so .   Well it was it was an at first firstly it was an attempt at a T_ Rex and then it sort of changed into a pelican                     Oops this is now coming apart , let me just put the top in .           Hopefully that'll stay on , two-handed version . Again this is off the top of my head , I was gonna do a big cat too , um . Oh dear , it doesn't look what like what I want it to be .         , that's it's meant to be an eagle you can tell it's a flying animal     I suppose they're all so independent , I'd put that one down again .           Indepen independent , right , did you say they're good at golf ?     I'd say they're quite free-spirited , flying around everywhere , doing their own thing .     And uh , birds of prey aren't they , oh dear , intrepid .         
   Um finance-wise , we've got a selling price at twenty five Euros , which I don't actually know what that is in Pounds , at all .       One point four Euro would make a Pound or something like that .                 I think so , I think so , I'll be able to um pull it up , or I could put it in the shared folder or something . Havi having said that though , if you wanna get one of those the the ones on the market at the moment they're s they're about twenty pounds anyway .       
         half of the selling price is taken up by building it .       You've got market range international and you did say earlier it's got to be a um accessible and usable by sort of all age groups just t we're not focusing on business market , any particular thing , it's everyone user-friendly to everyone .     I don't think it's a case of worrying about different languages and things like that , um making that a key point , just that it's going to be in the international market like Australia , America , things like that . 
         so we got one of the universal remote controls , um that you programme each of your things into , but that kept losing the signals so we'd have to re-programme it every now and again .               My experience has only been being given the remote control with the object I buy , not doing any tampering with it and programming , using it to programme T_V_ and uh uh videos and things . But basically on , off , volume up and down , channel one , two , th that basic functions , I don't think I could go any further with it than that , so , I suppose it's got to be something usable by someone like me as well . 
 Yeah , the main that's the main stuff anyway , I mean and you don't want to I hate I hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do and just sitting there searching for the teletext button or something like that .       Actually that just raises a point , I wonder what our design people think , but you know on a mobile phone , you can press a key and it gives you a menu , it's got a menu display , I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful , so you've got a little L_C_D_ display . Right , I was thinking on the same lines you , instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user , may h maybe have an L_C_D_ di display or something like that , like a mobile , yeah and with menus .       
   Um , my grandad can answer his mobile phone , but he couldn't even dream of texting or something like that .           So that's a problem regardless of of any design modifications you you come up with , that's gonna be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps , and that's another issue how we tackle that .     what everything's doing , 'cause I mean , menus on sort of new phones now they've sort of got all these pictures and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you're trying to do .   I d I don't like the , you know the new phones that have kind of got a Windows-based running system .     
 I find it really confusing , I kept getting lost in the phone , I di I've not got a new one         Yeah , I don't I don't know how for twenty fi , or twelve Euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get , you'd you'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white L_C_D_ thing anyway , I'd assume .         In that you've got the basic buttons just for your play , volume , programme things and also and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures , obvious symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that . The other thing is , just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again , it could have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top , your screen is you can have a bigger screen in the the flip over .         
 And there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone , it can still be lightweight plastic , you know ?       No uh uh Um , right , okay we've got half an hour before the next meeting , so we're all gonna go off and do our individual things .         The sort of I I had a quick look at the company website and it's like the the uh we put the fashion into electronics , so I think think the whole design thing might be qui         that was my main point , we don't have to use metal , I don't know if using plastic does make it cheaper , I presume it would .   
 I mean there's Sky remote controls and everything .
