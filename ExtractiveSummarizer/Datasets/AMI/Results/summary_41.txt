If you leave them on the whole time you get to look like a noodle the whole time .     three , apparently .       standard chip , um 'cause it can come in various different sizes , it wasn't uh uh gonna be a problem factor .     Um buttons with a combination of L_C_D_ and rubber according to the design . Um bright funky designs inspired by fruit , keeping with the hip kind of feel .     
 I think that would be you .   Me and William worked on a prototype , and I think William is going to make a p presentation on that . Yeah , shall I show ?   Though do you do you wanna do you wanna sh         Make sure the camera's I can hold it like   Wait a second , I'll get it out .           You should have one of those things and you can just take it off .         And we'll first look at the exterior of what we've uh come up with over there .   Mm 'kay . 
 It's gonna have a a plastic body um with a sort of standard colour , either we're thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something . Um it's obviously an a sort of clam-shell design and uh the um the top L_C_D_ screen that you can see that would b would be sort of um You able to look ? Yep . d so so it'll fully close flat . Oh right Um we decided that um the voice recognition system , it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of , so we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap . It wo it won't shout out             Um the standard , there's be a standard transmission with the T_V_ using using all the standard chips that we've talked about . Um it would it would have obviously 'cause it's split over two two different layers , it would need two separate P_C_B_s , so it would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling .         um sender would be on the on one of the bot the bottom layer , just at the front of the we haven't   
             So when it's even if it's open here , the signals would go .   So when you've actually got it open , it would be facing the T_V_ .   The top screen , as we said , is would be an inset um black and white L_C_D_ s touch screen which yeah would Yeah , that would make sense . 
 And now we've we also decided on the inside , we could possibly either have um some some kind of sort of bezzled No d not not actually . No , not uh interfering with l the whole look of the the product when it's uh on the thing . And finally that's how we put the fashion back into electronics , as that is that's the company logo . Thank you very much . Wrapping it all up , okay . Um I've now got evaluation criteria . Well done .   So this is the one .     Logged in ?       
 I think this is chip . This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research . So this is the first stage of the evaluation . Now the findings that we came up with , just a recap , are here . The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel , technological innovation , it should be easy to use , it should incorporate current fashion trends , and those the two main ones , they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours .       We're going to use a seven point scale , where one is true and seven is false .         Yes , we're going to come to w we'll discuss each one and we'll come to a consensus rating between one and seven . One is true , seven is false . 
 Right . It will just be criteria one , two , three , four , five , six , or A_ , B_ , C_ , Actually , it might be an idea , if we each did give our own individual rating , and we could take an average at the end . Criteria How do we feel about this prototype model relating to fancy it is a fancy look and feel . One is true , seven is false . Three . 'Kay . I would say two . A four , okay . Uh two and three quarters , it that right . I think yeah . Two point seven five , there we go .     I'd give it a one .   Oh sorry ,   The first one rating , I'm sorry . Can you just make it two ? 
 The average oh , for you ?   The first .             It's just two point five for that one . Two point five , okay . Losing one decimal place , that's okay . One is a , seven is false , okay . So what are you rating for this one , Paw ?       
 That brings it down to two , nice and simple , yeah . Two .       Two . I would say a two . I would say a two . 
 A two , okay .   We'll just put almost two , because I'm not gonna get into silly decimal places .     One point seven f five .     So I'm just thinking , before I give it my rating , you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here .   No , no , the the base colour was um white or or like or l sort of a light blue , but the changeable fa faces would uh allow you to get any basically any one of a number of colours that uh th 
 Right . So we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that's what we're intending to do . And the spongy feel is no problem with that . No , no , 'cause th Because of the rubber case . In that case it's got to be a one for me .       One . One . 
 That part was nice and easy .           Well the type of button that we're gonna use in the bottom half , the material , minimises       maybe because it's slightl with the size that we've got it's quite small , but with the amount of stuff we're putting on it isn't that much . So maybe because there's more space , it's not kind of moving around trying to hit accurately the buttons in between . It's quite obvious just big buttons .     I think I'm gonna have to be neutral on that and give it a four .     f I'd go for a five , actually , 'cause 
 Four . Four and a four okay . Four . Twenty one is that twenty one ? So that's four point two five .     Now we talked about voice recognition , we talked about a beeper , have we really have the designers come to any dec real decision on that ?           That is going to be feasible , cost-wise .     I'd go for a I ca we can adjust the volume on that , just as we could volume on T_V_ .   So if sombody's in the other room or if T_V_s in different rooms , or .   
 So it would be s p           Yeah , one . One and one , good .     We've got our our we've got the highest rating of meeting the specifications that is definitely true for two of the uh six criteria there .   The lowest rating we've got , which is really n it's not terribly low , i it's close around neutral is for uh the minimisation of repetitive strain injury . Do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it , or do we have to make further modifications ?           I think for most of those ratings that it's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that , and I really doubt on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities , we could actually do much more to minimise that .   Well , I hope that's uh clear to the team .     
 Good .         Okay , I've got finance here now .       You want me to b unplug that ?                   See , it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning .   Right , what's happening with the electronics ? It was a regular chip on print and Chip on print .   Oh , no , no , no , the um Yeah , it's you you've put in three for the number of kinetic cells , there should just be one .       Yeah , and yeah , just a no , one reg v uh So , would there be two ? One chip . Yeah , one of them and one sample sensor and sample speaker .       One double curve . Two , 'cause it's two . Two curves , yeah .           It would just be a flat bottom with one curve .   So just one double Single-cu One double-curved . And one no , 'cause one one's double-curved , and then the other one's   
 The other curves at the sides , but it's slightly flattened at the bottom so it doesn't roll over .     Plastic one and maybe rubber point five .   No I think rubber , since it's being used just as a casing , we can put point five .   I think it allows the point five ,   What does it mean if you put point five for that ?         
 So we're not actually using plastic in the case , are we ?         But it is gonna be part of the total cost , and there's nowhere else we can we can put that in , is there ?     Okay , we'll just put it in as we'll put in as half . Or sh we should just put it in as one , because the plastic is zero anyway . No , we don't step on anyone's toes .   
     Push-button . Yeah , the push-button's one and L_C_ display one . One . One . 
         Has that not made any d if you click off that square now , has that not made any difference ?       Oh no , it was seven five   So is is uncurved completely and just actually making the rubber case the curved thing , is that going to make a difference ?         No , it just surprises one . Oh , it's not calculated it . No , no , you've got to click off to calculate it again .         C it might uh you might you might be assuming that that is in Euros . It could be in Dollars . And then it would be fine , because the exchange range would make it about twelve .   
 Is there anything on the menu We haven't been dealin we haven't been dealing with dollars though , I think   Okay , so the highest we've got is the electronics here . and the interface . If we tr um . 
 If we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries , would that make a huge difference ?   Yeah , the standard , it um it would make one difference . The biggest one would be taking away if you took away Yeah .       And people are used to buying batteries , they're not gonna say I'm not getting this , 'cause I've got to buy a battery for a remote control .     
     If you took away that , that'll make it twelve point three five .     If we change it to the battery it's that's minus three . They n n yeah , but you p minus three plus two .   
 I keep seeing zero .       But they but I mean in I don't see why we have to sell it for twenty five Euros now , because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product .       Make it costly . We can put in our recommendations .     And I think the voice recognition sounds wonderful , but our object is so distinctive that that in itself is gonna make it easier to locate as a f you know in a first instance . Um as you say , we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers and so 
 make the price fit , and then say if we'd had our budget , we would've had this , because it also sets it apart from the crowd .       'Cause we've done all the background work to go for that if they want it .     Twelve point three five . Is it twelve point fif was it twelve point fifty ? 
 Two five . It's two point five . No , it's twelve point two five .   Sorry , not meaning to doubt your words there . Yeah well two , twelve point two five times two is   Are they really going to quibble about ten P_ ? twenty five , isn't it ? It's twelve point five maybe , then . Or point zero one of a Euro ?     So half of the price would be I think the agenda one was where the um price was , wasn't it ? I think it is the first one . That's today's kick off meeting , . Twelve point five .                 Yeah , I think that's brilliant .         I presume we discussed leadership and teamwork .       Or did you feel like uh autonomy ?   Although we had our separate tasks , there was so much interaction , so much that we needed to um bounce off each other . And I've certainly felt heard , listened to in that in relevant areas we've been able to , you know , give and take and adjust our remit where necessary . I think we had a nice time .   Yeah , I think there was uh very constructive feedback by everybody .   There is more of uh true cohesive teamwork . We came to a very predic creative design , yeah .   And Sarah , you coordinated the work very well .           I liked the fact that we could say an idea and it'd be suggested that that wasn't the best idea , but no one felt like shot down , you know ,       Well you two created that wonderful specimen of a Play-Doh model .         Maybe we should think of branching out into children's toys and fake mobile phones as a side line .     'Kay . 
 No , that was quite fun .     How do we evaluate the materials we had for communicating and sharing information ? Could it've been better , was it adequate ? Yeah , I think I think we probably woulda used the outer email system more , had we actually     
   Um like the whole picture of the thing .           I mean nothing is new , but it's applying it to a d in a different area .         Um as was shown by your presentation with all of the other controls , remote controls , no one's thought about it particularly . I mean they're slightly different , so if someone's been shut in the room and said make ours a bit different from everyone else's , 'cause it's w something we should think about , but obviously no one's put any great deal of thought into it . Yep , sorry , go on Sarah . 
 Can't you get the one that we used for the last one ? Yeah , just jazz it up a bit . Uh d they don't really think about it , because normally , the remote control isn't the product which they're trying to ship .   and they design it on Photoshop and then they just get it printed on the plastic   But people could have anything that they wanted .     Like Sarah was telling , everything's Because of the produ I think it's really good that this has been very market research based , because just going back to mobile phones , I mean this is the first change in remote control devices that I can really , you know , say is is obvious and visible . We see it in mobile phones a lot , and tha that's where we've borrowed a lot of our ide our ideas from .   I see people wanting a model of the phone they were really happy with , and they can't get it anymore and it's innovation for innovation's sake , and I think it's wonderful our company's so R_ and D_ based . Right . Yes . Well , it's innovation for money's sake . The the people have to keep buying . But forcing it onto people , yeah . 
 It's things that , you know , they might want to buy the thing they really want .     Or there isn't a cover to fit it or whatever , yeah .         Um our costs are below budget with recommendations that they the budget be increased , but I think I don't know , d what do you think ? Do you think that's takes into account um overheads   And the heating for the building , do you think our budget includes everything , all the costs that are going out ?   
 well it looks like it's gonna be fifty percent profit , you've still got all of the overheads to come out of that . But I think but you were saying that that's quite I don't from the market research .     I don't think that's something we have to look at and find a way of raising the cash for . I think we've done very well to get within budget and it still makes such an innovative item that I think people are really gonna want .   Maybe it will . Maybe someone'll r run down and patent it . I know . Maybe it will . Maybe they are gonna steal our ideas and sell it . Who knows ? 
 Um the project has been evaluated well and truly .           I think the celebration is the twenty five pounds .   Oh . Questionnaire . Um yeah , just the last , I think . Awesome . I think I've got minutes for two of the meeting and the last thingy .   Oh , I didn't have to rate you on how much you influenced the meeting this time . Was that not the questionnaire for the how you felt you'd done in your thing ?
