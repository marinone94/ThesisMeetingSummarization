Okay , so Right well um from the last meeting I was trying to send you the minutes , but uh it didn't work out too well , so maybe in sort of um quick summary of the last uh meeting , I can quickly give you so we had the fact that we're gonna have the the logo uh the company logo in its uh colour scheme incorporated onto the the device the remote device . And the customers wouldn't have to look at them too often , only as and when required . I think we all have a presentation again , so if we go through those and then um Three presentation , I see this a little more smoothly than the last one .  Okay right , let's get started . Um basically the uh for the Um I'll back actually . For the components design , um next step is basically the the way the remote's gonna work is still the same idea as before . Uh first in the power supply , we have the option of just the standard battery , um . Any of you think of kind of like the the old torches which you wind up um . For the buttons , we have um an integrated push button , which is Oh just to say all all these are um supplied by Real Reaction . So I guess for the ease of for quickness and ease we should take them from at least like one of these options . Um there's a scroll wheel which is you know the new mouse has just got like the centre section which you can scroll up and down , which may be for the volume . You could do do that . Um one issue for the buttons is , depending on which material we use , if we use rubber buttons then it requires a rubber case , so we have to take that into consideration . Um that's on the next th I think the there wasn't too much difference in the cost , that that related to the actual buttons , but it does affect the printed circuit board . Um and I guess that would require a more advanced circuit board , so there is an extra price in that sense . There is th sorry an extra cost in that sense . Um going to my personal preferences , um I thought possibly for power we could use kinetic um which is the idea of the watches um that you move you move the remote around to power it up .   'Kay . with the printed circuit boards you were going for the it kind of depends um if we're gonna have the speech recognition , we'd have to probably get an advanced one .   Uh but I don't know , so that is something I'll have to look into . 
 But are we going f R right . 'Cause at that point then you've got the details up there , so if we wanted to know for instance that the scroll wheel required the regular and what required advance . Then if we were able to see that down then we could make the decision at that point in time and then that would be the end of that issue . Does that make sense ?         It's just this bit at the bottom which I've highlighted , but the scroll wheel requires a mini m minimally a regular chip , which is in the higher price range . The display requires an advanced chip the display requires an advanced chip which in turn is more expense . I think the scroll wheel um Also the display's for something else which we decided against .   
 And note that the push button just requires a simple chip , so that would keep the price down .         Kay . So maybe just a simple push button , and that would cut costs on the   Yeah , a simple pushbuttons .   Did everyone get this on the speech recognition ? The um it was basically what we said before , the idea that you record in a set 
 message , and then it picks up that message um and replies to you .   Um but then we don't know for sure whether it would require a more complicated circuit board . I'm guessing it would , but got like the definite information .     Or are we going for the regular ? Um if it's just the push button then it just needs the simple circuit board . 
   okay , that's true for the for for that element , but we have to take all el elements into consideration . And so if there is one element that requires the more expensive one , or say the regular one , or the more advanced , then that would have to be the same for all of them .   But the way that I interpret that um it doesn't seem to send out a signal to the telly , it just it's like a parrot just rep reply replying to your message . So I don't think it would effect our circuit board .             'Cause the example that they've given there is good morning coffee machine , good morning Jo . It might be useful to say like where are you remote . Here I am , Jo . But I think that's maybe as far as that one could go ?   
 an extra possibility .       W w kinetic . You were you were wanting to go for the kinetic power supply . And it says that I think it said the cost of that isn't too much . I thought so just for just for ease of not having to replace the batteries . 
 And how does it get uh charged up ? It's um it's some on watches which you you kind of you shake to power it up . So you'd you'd move the remote around a little bit and then that powers it up to use it . Are we going for speech recognition ? 'Cause that required the advanced Yeah , I think so . Just just for the call and find thing .       Um I think I might have got that wrong .   Speech recognition you reckon then is s simple . And so we would want it in as an extra because it doesn't appear to cost too much .     
 it's just an addition thing 'Kay . 'Kay shall I pass on to you now ?     I'll just just check what it said . Actually I don't think it really says anything about the cost , but it says that it's already in the coffee machines , so   kind of I assume it would cost extra , but   And then have to change all change everything at the last minute . 
 Oh , that was quick . Um I haven't actually got the examples of the scroll button there , um but there's some curved cases that you can see , uh a range of sizes uh . Sorry ? Yeah , I've found that try and get it back .       Um some of the uh remotes that I looked at , one of the models da did actually have voice recognition where you could um     And uh it was quite uh a swish model , where it can control uh four devices , T_V_ , cable , satellite , video , D_V_D_ , audio . Um so that's a bit of competition there .   
 like different viewpoint as a kind of finding your lost control rather than trying to compete with the functions . Um the scroll buttons , as you've already mentioned , um Um but I don't know if that's really in our field ? I guess I guess we're going for the biggest market , maybe not , but Was it was it specified that we went for the biggest ?     You'd have model one , model two and model three , and therefore you can sub-divide your market up .           So so what are we deciding to do here ? I think because there's already um very good voice recognition technology out there , and because ours might not cover the same functions that the leading brands do , it might be a good idea to market it as a um finder function . Right .   So you also said for going for the international market um that some some maybe older people might not like the speech recognition . Oh yeah . Different languages might not be compatible . It w it would make it quite complicated , where um ours at least keeps it fairly simple and then the Yeah , 'cause I think you program um this one yourself , like to say like whatever you want to your question . Yeah and ours is quite a cheap device , so I don't know how much we'll be able to put into it . So you'd have a finder feature rather than a voice recognition feature . And you were talking Maybe unless something else comes up .   Um yeah I think um I think we've decided that it's gonna increase the cost and give no real kinda extra benefit and it's gonna decrease from the sleekness of it .       So not to be focused on . 
 Um there was a mention just as kind of a warning about button design . I'm just gonna check so I do this right . Um I think the thing was that if you decide to do this , to have triangular buttons , um somebody might look at this one and say oh well this triangular button is pointing up , and that's the first thing that they see Oh well , no , they might see       So , be careful what you put on the buttons and be careful of the shape that you make them , because they might be kind of two um   Yeah I I know what you mean . So maybe we could have volume written on the side and then up and down on the on the buttons themselves . 
 And 'cause the idea was to have limited um it was to have sizable amount of information on it . Limited number of buttons . Yeah we got it down to not too many . Um and I think that's all I had to say for that .   Are we are we gonna go through the design of all the buttons at the moment , or are we gonna t I've I've got some things to say about possible design things from   Cool . Right , um I've been looking at some trends 
 So we've had people in Paris and Milan watching the uh fashion trends . So just to summarise the most important things which came out of the remote control market investigation . The most important thing was that the thing sort of look and felt fancy rather than just functional . And second , there should be some technological innovation . And then third and l less important than the other two , there should be an ease of use as well . Um but um the feel of the material should be spongy , which is contrary to last year , apparently . we need to emphasise the fancy design with on on our remote control above all else . And then we need to ma sort of make it easy to use that's as a third priority , so perhaps um fewer fewer buttons and functions as we've as we've discussed . And then maybe find a way to incorporate these trends so that we sort of capture people's imaginations .  So maybe we could make the buttons shaped like fruit and veg , or the the buttons could be spongy , uh somehow . Maybe we could make them out of rubber rather than sort of hard plastic .   Right , so that'll be it .     I think if you start making the buttons fruit shaped , it might make it more complicated to use . Well you were just talking about you 
 Maybe just one button , say the standby button is quite kinda separate from all the other functions . Maybe that could be a little apple . And then that wouldn't get in the way of like kinda one to nine , and it wouldn't confuse the numbers .       I guess maybe fruit and vegetables may be popular at the moment , but   
 What are they gonna be next year .   but you you can incorporate the tr If y if you change all the buttons then you've got the problem that this year's fruit and veg , next year's uh I was gonna say animals or elephants or w whatever . That means you're constantly changing your production schedule , and you've gotta make different moulds and everything else , so that's not a good idea I would I would suggest .     I mean it just seems realistic that the remote control market isn't the kind of thing which takes in   to something which is maybe more universal . But I suppose as long as it's quite a subtle design , um even if the design kind of changes , We c maybe can imply a fruit shape possibly .               
 one of the things were if you had rubber buttons then you had to have a rubber case .       it's if you use the uh rubber double curved case then you must use rubber buttons . That's the way round .   Which makes sense .     
 And that would fit in with what we want , wouldn't it , for the spongy feel , to have everything rubber .     Whereas if you kept the product the same but you could have a difference from year to year , uh it seems to me that you could incorporate a fashion statement if you like , rather than changing the whole kit and caboodle .       that yes . Well you two are obviously gonna find that out fairly quickly when you move over to your kit modelling stage as to uh how much pl how much how much how pliable is Plasticine . Maybe we could think of the the cases like changing with the fashions like the Nokia phones where you could take the casing off the outside . 
 But whether that would be too much to incorporate in production , whether that would just increase the costs , make it more complicated . So you're talking there about uh changing Oh but you still would have to have the logo on every new case , but you could have like pink cases for girls and red ones and things like that .       which four do you want , as long as it's black ?                   I mean a lot of um computers for instance like like on the one you've got there , it actually has a sort of um stick on badge so what you would al all you would really need , whether it , you know , whether the casing be w any colour , could be any colour , but that badge would then have to stick out on top of it so that uh in a sense , with a with a logo like that , because it's on a white background , the only colour that it might not stick out so well on would be a white casing . 
 And in fact a lot of companies get somebody else to make them and literally just badge them themselves with their own uh badge over the top . And whether we'd have a big enough market to have this kind of like secondary market of selling the cases Well if it's for young people , um like the phone generation , that sort of thing'd probably go down well , and the market research has been on that side of things , hasn't it ? Yeah , I mean it's people say that it's the look , they want the fancy looking thing I think with the mobiles , Did we decide on the rubber case ? The trend was different last year apparently . It was not not spongy feel . I don't know whether it's one of those things that     Sounds reasonable . y you're gonna end up hating in a year , you know . If you're going for fashion trends like that they'll need t you'd have to have interchangeable cases so that you could or 'cause otherwise someone's gonna have to buy a complete new remote rather than just a case .   that would it seems to make sense that we we'd just maybe stick with the standard rubber case , and then have the standard rubber buttons as well . Uh we haven't really talked about uh the curvature of the case . There's flat , there's single-curved and there's double-curved . I'm not exactly sure what these things look like . 
 Maybe curves give it like the slightly more aesthetic feel ? But the double curve wouldn't require us to perform miracles with the Plasticine .             See how uh the one Oh I'm not plugged in , am I ? 
 One one thing to cons one thing to consider is that in some ways you want um by having a fairly standard case it means they can all fit together on top of each other therefore for storage purposes in shops and the like That should come up . So shall we go through quickly and just work out what we've decide on , if we have to kind of Um it's not very clear up there , but you can see some of them have got kind of bulges , like the second one and the end one uh where there's a curve there . so do you wanna go for curves , more curves ?   we're meant to be finishing this meeting in about a minute or so . Definitely a single , maybe a double . Kay , so shall we quickly Shall we go for single curve , just to compromise ?     Okay , curved or double curved ?   So did we did we decide on the kinetic power supply ? The one you move around ?           Um and we don't really know much about the colour scheme or logo yet do we , but possibly a sticker . Oh we ca       I think we can by by not having anything too complicated .       
 And see we could always decide against it if something comes up   And then are we going for sort of one button shaped like a fruit .   Yeah that sounds like it wouldn't do too much harm in a couple of years .       
 That's ru rubber buttons , yeah . So it's rubber buttons , so it's not really spongy feel buttons , it's just rubber buttons .   Reasonably spongy I guess , 
 Yeah , so it's not too wacky .   Um I think an apple would be a good recognisable shape .     A apple .         Anyone got any suggestions ?   Apple apple a a qu Quite a big one , as well . A big apple . We will go for the a a a apples apples .    Could be a red apple , yeah . Either , don't mind . 
     Just like the Just working out what we're gonna do for the next time . Yeah that seems pretty straight forward . 'Cause most of them will just be kind of mainly circular or like very plain . 'Kay . 
 Sorry what was that last thing again there ?         And j yeah , just keeping the sort of the labelling them labelling of them fairly simple as well . Fairly sort of self explanatory . Right , so shape of buttons simple .
