So where's the PowerPoint presentation ? Sorry ? So basically we've got three things , and we've got forty minutes in which to uh for this meeting to uh to discuss the various options . I see , right . That's nice to know , one from each of you . We discussed that last time and in actual fact that was pr pretty well what we came up with anyway . So I I got that in email form . So we'll start with yourself on the basis that uh Okay that's fine . Alt function F_ eight . There's usually a little thing in the top right for the Oh hang on , it's just coming on . Ah there , it's doing something . Okay , I think we're there . That's good . Okay , um Okay I'm gonna be looking at the working design . Um I've just got three sections , first is the research I made on the on the remote control itself um . And then also the methods in which these components interact together for the remote to actually do what you want it to do and how it connects with the television . Um the basic components are an energy source which I guess um in most existing models would be a battery supply . We then have the user interface , which is basically the like the the buttons on the actual remote . Um the various functions used for changing channel , uh channel up and down , volume , things like that . Okay . is usually , I've found , an infra-red device which sends a signal to the actual television . Um I'm gonna have to actually draw on the board because uh it was a little tricky on PowerPoint to get this working , Uh no , a power supply which we'd probably get it's probably gonna be the battery . Um we then have a particular button , which may be that's obviously Um but this is how the basic system works . Um this is the chip itself , which then , and that's the that's the infra-red sender . And then on the separate thing we have on the on the television we have a a receiver . So the the top bit's the power source , yes ? . it's not really a remote . Um and then the sender , and infra-red um has been used quite successfully . If the battery's on reasonable power , they always seem to work fairly well . 'Kay and that's it for the moment . Right . Thank you . Is it control function ei Oh , th there you go . I'm Louisa , the User Interface Designer , as you know . Um an example of the function could be to change the volume up or down , uh so obviously you need two different buttons for that . Um to change the channel , either by pressing the number that you want or by channel up or down . Um to switch the television on or off , maybe a standby button . Uh but as you can see , the left remote is quite um quite busy looking , quite complicated . Um so my personal preference would be the right remote . So , it's got nice big buttons , it's got a very limited number of buttons . Could maybe do with some more colour . uh I got an email that basically said to uh make sure that uh whatever device we come up with at the end of the day had to incorporate um the corporate colour and slogan . _ that might be the corporate colour scheme , although the only the only colour I can see in that is the red . Would you be able to get rid of the the extra buttons here , the the sort of circular section , because that seems to be for a video as well .   Possibly ? What do you mean by the circular section ? 
     I mean how often do you use seven , eight and nine ?       the on the Well uh for for general television purposes obviously you have channels one to five at this point in time , and we'd have to have some room for uh future such channels .   But , well possibly but the the other thing is that with um the current expansion of uh channels uh in the process of taking place , certainly the button up and down , but uh I mean how many channels do we have to um actual television channels do we have to uh prepare for ?   
 it's forever expanding and at the moment we've got although you've onl So I would've thought that we wouldn't , you know , rather Okay , if the time of flicking from one to other , but presumably it'll take a second 'cause you have to be able to stop it . Maybe you could have a fast forward on the on the channels that w and then you could dispense with more otherwise . But I think a lot of um like Cable and Sky and stuff , that would be tuned to one channel , and then you'd have another remote for all of those channels . Like to get to fifty five and the higher numbers But I suppose nine's not really excessive . I suppose it does make a good pattern . I suppose with nine you've got the the like the last one which makes the tenth means you           yeah , you could get fifty by five and a zero or whatever , that that makes sense .   Um I think that's just for a video , so we wouldn't need any of that at all .   
 eleven twelve th We got fourteen that we need . That'll be quite easy to make a user guide for a fourteen button remote .   was one of the considerations .           Right , okay , so basically time to market seems to be important , therefore speed of delivery . We've only got about another four hours left . ' Kay . Okay , so is everyone happy with that ? 
 yes , that seems good . Right well that's the end of my presentation . ' Kay . Yeah , I think she said twenty seconds to um Uh-huh . I'll give it another go . And first off we should state that th the remote control's for controlling the T_V_ and um how do people use it ? And young people were quite receptive to this , but as soon as we got sort of over about into a thirty five to forty age forty five age group and older , people people weren't quite so keen on speech recognition . there's a lot lot more older people who didn't know whether they wanted it or not as well . Um we also asked what frustrated people about remote controls and the number one frustration was that the remote was lost somewhere else in the room and that they couldn't find it . Okay , so My personal preferences from the marketing is that we need to come up with some sort of sleek sort of good looking high high-tech A design which looks high-tech , basically . Um and that we should come up with fewer buttons than most of the controls on the market , and we should sort of concentrate on the channels and sort of power , and also volume and that sort of thing , as as Louisa said . Um we could maybe come up with a menu , a sort of a an L_C_D_ menu for other functions on the remote control . That that might be the market that we're we're looking for . And we could maybe think about using speech recogniti recognition as a way to find the remote control if it's lost in a room , rather than sort of um having it to speech recognition to change the channels .             Youn young people pref       and they might end up costing more than our twelve fifty budget for           Maybe we can have some kind of sensor which is kept somewhere where you can some kind of buzzer system between the two . So you can press a button which is always kept in one place and then it maybe buzzes to somewhere else , wherever the remote actually is .   Yeah , we'd have t that would mean we'd have to put two products together as well , which which again would probably be a bit expensive , but That is true , yes .       Well if you're trying to avoid having a second product 'cause obviously you could have a second product that gave you the right pitch which would set the remote off to say here I am sort of thing , you know without sound recognition . You'd want to try and av just have the one product Yeah if we if we could have it in the actual remote like everything in one one device .     and you can give it a command , a set command whatever that happened to be .       
 So that would solve the problems with the T_V_ kind of speaking to the remote and changing its own channels .           It's that simple , because we've got uh th th three um primary um uh requisites from uh from and email uh that was sent to me whereby we had The design logo was one , which we've already mentioned .   And the uh third thing was that um teletext uh as far as uh the management is concerned , um is becoming dated uh due to the popularity of the internet . 
 So that means that uh so these are the sort of three um extra parameters that have been put on this uh project .     'Kay .             Added extras would be nice , but the primary consideration is to get the project finished within uh this short time window , which effectively now is sort of four hours .   Uh d d I think I think first and foremost we've gotta get to the end and then get to the end with um added extras if possible .     So I don't know how long we have left of our uh time .   each person that's got a a a task to do is clear from this meeting what that task is .   I um so we'll know how long we've got to complete that task .     yes , we've achieved this or we haven't achieved this , this is how far we've progressed . Does that make reasonable sense ?     And if dur between the time of this meeting finishing and the next meeting starting , if you get any additional information that uh only you have at that point in time you'd think would be relevant to other people in terms of their des decision making um process , then we should communicate that as quickly as possible and not wait until the next meeting .   
 Come along with it in the next meeting , we can discuss it then and take whatever action is appropriate .         and it'd be a big advantage if we did have some sort of um kind of whistle back kind of function . 'Cause that'll solve kind of the frustration of losing it . Yeah and that was that was the number one sort of frustration that people said , so . 
         Uh if if our primary consideration is to get it there in time , time's short , you want something to meet the major concerns of the consumer so that we can have that as a selling point for the product , something that's quick and simple .   And that wouldn't put off the kind of older generation either , 'cause everyone can whistle or clap , and they wouldn't have to be kind of scared of this new technology . 
 Well , so maybe a clap rather than a whistle would be On the basis that if we've got if we're catering to the whole age range , you want something that's easy to do , now something that doesn't like whis               'Kay we've already decided that we don't need a teletext button , haven't we ?       Did we decide on having the ten um the ten numbers and then the the little digit next to it which kind of enabled you to put them together .     I think nowadays you can just get ones where it gives you a sort of a second or two to press another number , so you can press any two and it'll sort of put them together . Okay , ten numbers and then some kind of device to allow uh   
 Or multiple digits .     You had an had an idea about the menu ? Uh we could possibly put an L_ a sort of a L_C_D_ menu in , but that again is probably an expense that   So and if finally the T_V_ breaks , you get a new one , you're gonna have to be able to tune it . You can't really avoid that . Except the new digital markets which do it by themselves .   
 But at the moment it's not , so it seems to me that you have to have a device that caters , 'cause otherwise it would make it uh your device would become inoperable , or only operable in certain circumstances and the idea is to have an international market which is           terribly high-tech .           Would you maybe have like one menu button , then you'd use the other buttons , maybe the number buttons to actually do the separate functions .       My dad was watching a film the other week   so I had to go through it and turn the brightness up . we're gonna have the the individual numbers and then a menu function and maybe sort of a slightly more advanced um instruction booklet to come with it , to guide Presu   I'm not sure whether the sort of having people have a booklet 'cause one the second most annoying thing that people found was having to learn the new one .     that also goes back to the original design when we saw those two , and there was the one on the left hand side which had all like the double functions and stuff which kind of looked too busy and had too much on it , so .   Well , if we're trying to keep it slee sleek and sexy as well , have you seen those remotes where kind of um the bottom bit slides down , so there's kind of um everything else revealed ?       
     Right we've got five minutes before we wind up this meeting , so I've been told .       Sor sort of a second . Like a hidden panel .   And that'll be better for the older generation as well 'cause , well my dad doesn't like anything that you've got to kinda flick through a menu , but he can pretty much read a button if it's displayed properly .   So we're gonna have like two separate two separate lists , I guess .     Can bring out when needed .   
 The detailed ones would be sort of brightness , uh sorta     So you've got which ones are gonna be on the front and which ones are gonna be on the back .                         And probably a power one as well .     not an issue to raise here , but um the whole thing about not using your standby uh because of the like waste of electricity .   Like if you boil the kettle that's full that's a waste . If you leave your telly on standby it powers Blackpool for a certain amount of time .   But then they might not buy it if they haven't got one .       oh danger sign . 
 So so are you having the stand-by on the front , then ?             Um 'cause yeah the market research said there is quite a lot of people do just zap around and flick , so .   So we've got ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen there ?     What was that , sixteen ? Numbers is ten , volume is twelve , th si One up , one down .           That's sixteen isn't it , yeah .       That's sixteen buttons , you reckon .       Maybe if we're gonna run out of time , one of us should come up with a list of these and then get back at the next meeting just at the start and say what they're gonna be .     You're also gonna have the channel tuner , as it were .   So tuner up and down , I guess . Tuner , would that have up and down ? . Tune one way , tune the o I dunno I dunno possibly . I think they normally do .   
 sort of s you know , saying that you want that particular thing tuned in .   and then it pick it finds something and then you wanna press enter to select it ,   and th and a enter button just to select .         there's quite a lot of like Dolby surround studio , surround sort of things .     Um I think they've got their own controls in this kind of like hidden panel . 
 Yeah I suppose if we've got their if they've got their own controls then we can avoid it for ours just to keep it simple .     I just know they're something to do with Dolby . Oh , okay . Maybe unless something comes up then we should I think Well shall we look into that and just get back together .
