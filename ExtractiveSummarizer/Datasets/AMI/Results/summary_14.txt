I'll wait until you're all um hooked up . Oh good grief . 
     Welcome back everybody , hope you've had fun .   Right um this is our conceptual design meeting , um I think we're slightly ahead of ourselves       This is where we talk about um properties , materials , user-interface and trend-watching . 
 So I think we've touched on a few things to do with that already , but we'll just go over it . Um the minutes from the last time . Um we have decided on a leaving out the voice recognition , we've decided on there being a flip design and um a different shape from what's normal .   Okay , so shall we start with the first presentation ?   'Kay . Shall I ? We just connect up .  Thank you . There we go . Okay um so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching . Um the methods we used to decide on uh 
 current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional uh our usual market research study uh with a hundred subjects and the the general feedback from them is that the most im uh w I'm sorry       So that was one of the first things we did . Also with our company um being forerunners in uh putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update um using our consultants on fashion and design in Paris and Milan .       Now I should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use . So possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important , but it's third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at . Okay , um , now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , um we found from our um consultants in Paris and Milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture .         'Kay .           Kay .     especially if you do them on too tight and you can't get the leverage on them to undo them . 'Kay , 
 Into the method . The the main idea of the whole thing is just so you sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the T_V_ and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find .   Kay . Um , findings , I've got my nice little picture there . This is uh the chip called the T_A_ double one eight three five which is what's used in pretty much every remote control 'cause it sends out standard signals , based on your input and um it's pretty much used for all all T_V_ remotes at the moment .   'Kay .           It might Wa can you explain that ?   How what kind of how l long can you get out of that , I mean can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that's it for the night ?         you think of the next two options , like the the solar charging , 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway   That doesn't count though does it ? Does does light charge as as sunlight does ?   I thought it was U_V_ like No .       Regarding those sizes , which one you think will be light because we we have to take into consideration size also , so maybe     the dynamo would take more space 'cause you actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up . I'm pretty sure that solar is from the sun . Uh , I don't think it counts electric lights no , but I mean not many you don't want to limit your market . I mean people who live in basement flats there's not that many people , but there are people .         But I I think I think the the next one's the best anyway .     and you d you don't even notice it .   
 it charges into um well I do but I've never seen one run out . But then if you think about a watch , it's on your wrist so it's on your whole bod so you're walking around , you're doing things , it is moving a lot of the time . If you'd I mean you switch the T_V_ on , then you put it on the side , then you pick it up to change it Is it really gonna be enough ? I think it is because if you think about it , the watch , although it's only a tiny amount             Could I just ask referring back to solar charging , is that compatible with um standard batteries ?   you know they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charging or the two things not compatible ? So it's not the draw on it isn't Ye   you could have a dual um power thing but the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case and they because , if you lie on a calculator they   they're quite big and they all they all look i identical . Solar would be slightly expensives .   What kind of price are we looking at for I presume the normal batteries are the cheapest ? It's twelve point f Yeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest I'd presume then it would actually be the the solar charging ones , um but the I think they're not very resistant to dropping , 'cause if you drop stuff   but I mean if remotes always get thrown around and stuff , so .               
       W w which one would last the longest , because we don't want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day .         well you know how long the standard double A_s would last in or triple A_s would last .       Okay , can we add in uh an attachment to closing feature ?     Shouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in because I I personally right , okay .     But then maybe that's looking at someone who's just sitting on their own rather than the eternal battle for control of the controls .   when we threw it open to the field       Um , my second part of my findings uh the mo most current remotes use this silicone uh P_C_B_ board which pr printed circuit board , which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button , it'll connect the circuit and each each switch is connected to two uh different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then uh gets translated by the chip into a code and then it's fired out of this L_E_D_ in the sequence of l on and off bursts . What kind of things do we have to consider there ? Can we what kind of size , does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size and we would have to fit the design of     it's simply spaced like that so you can have fit the n the size of the nine buttons in . If you if you see how thin the tracks are , you could you could s you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one , if you if you wanted to   array of switches which I'll speak about in the next bit so that And then to uh yeah , so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode no while not being used . Now what I was thinking about that was 'cause sometimes when y when you have these things , they've got little lights on behind the buttons , so you can see what all the buttons are , like on a mobile phone , they do it more often than on a than on a T_V_ remote , but you could you could have lights behind the buttons and um after like five or ten seconds of not being used   Um , the case material , I've a been sent what the factory can actually give us , the there's the plastic which I think we were gonna go for anyway as the main case case housing and the the main problems with the well you could go for wood   Titanium um very expensive just to process , which to make it is expensive , and rubber , well you're saying that people like this uh spongy feel this year , so perhaps uh some something made of rubber , but I was thinking more of the buttons , because the buttons which they've they've said   are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it's meant to be anti R_S_I_ .   Um the problem with the casing is that uh there's     But whether whether or not because we'd have it in two separate units Second thing is yeah and second question is like , a mobile you can change the cover , you call it a skin or whatever .                     is it's light and strong but I think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for It does mark quite easily too if you let it fall .               Like a rubber sleeve almost , yeah .       It could it would be comfortable to hold on also . Very cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy a new one if they want to .         so just by touching it with your finger it'd make the connection 'Kay . over if you had them close enough , that would be one option . 
 Um the second option th they offer rubber buttons , but I thought that an L_C_D_ type of screen 'cause one they're incredibly thin um and don't take up much space , two they you can have them in a sort of array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of set thing and you could have them like a touch       Oh on the on the L_C_D_ screen you could becau you could fit it the problem with it basically is that it's flat and so you can't do lots of curve curved things with it , but um you can you wouldn't have with the L_C_D_       
 Oh it would be flat inside . You could have a flat screen inside , yeah , but I'm just wondering whether we want an L_C_D_ screen inside .       'Kay .   Now how would you distinguish , if you had it bare , how would you distinguish where you had to press , I mean     I just had another idea , I don't know if it helps with that , but just to do with the R_S_I_ .       Like one of the palm pop thing . They're easy to replace as well , cheap . Absolutely , f for somebody who very often , if he would a person who switches channels very often or does use a particular function very often will find it very irritating to use a and he might spoil the touch-pad very fast compared to a button like , if you keep punching with an pointer or whatever . It would have to be attached . Yeah just a thought they wouldn't actually need one and they could use anything they've got , couldn't they ?           And just one small question before like you are , regarding the circuit , since we are hav having a flip-top , we can customise the two circuits for different type of buttons like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons under this thing , so we can divide the circuit like you know . Yeah yeah that that would be fairly simple , I mean you'd you'd actually have two separate you'd have two separate circuit boards but they'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between them , 'cause in the in the actual flip bit you'd have some linking . I'll just raise another point while it occurs to me , it kind of applies to both our designers here ,         We're marketing to guys as much as we are to women .           oh shit I should go and have a shower and do my hair before I put the T_     I kinda got sidetracked onto   trying to think of other features we can build in that wouldn't cost too much but maybe we'll leave that one on the side . 'Kay . 
 I mean you can you could do it , you could have a 'cause if you if you just put the full charge through an L_C_D_ display it'll completely blank it out , but I don't know if you could get any mirror effect on it   Oh I think forget about the mirror that was just a very quick passing thought   First thing is uh basically on design we just took the input from the previous meeting , especially from the marketing and industrial design , to check on the customer needs and feasibility . Second is we checked into competitors , the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here . So y you generally see there's not much of variety and like marketing team said uh , people need trendy , they are bored of black and white . So you generally see rectangular shape , very monotonous kind of designs here . And uh second thing is there's too much of confusion here .       I found th that uh only common feature is the ch uh channel control and uh volume control , rest other buttons , they are in a very disorganized and they are not consistent th with other models and all . Okay , and second as already discussed with William , we are going to have m maybe a G_ G_U_I_ interface in the f in the middle of the flip-top and g graphic user interface basically which is what we d do in computer , have icons or touch pad or whatever , which is     if you have like buttons that appear on the screen in this L_C_D_ screen .   something y you have is a good example of G_U_I_ graphic user interface .       So he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent surfer .   Can we swap that round so th that the ones that we use all the time are on the bottom part ?             You us if we just use the shell as an example again , you open that , you've got your L_C_D_ display there and you've got the buttons there     That's what I was just saying , and then have the and then have the L_C_D_ at the top and then be able to touch that for the other controls , so have the um the volume and the programme , things like that , on the lower side .   And the lower distance . Oh f perfect . So the findings are too many cluttered buttons . Repetition of certain but buttons which I already explained , example the volume and channel control buttons .   Okay we had a latest finding of voice recognition , there was a mail which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature .     Some kind of thing or it gives a b bleep sound or some kind of sound and if this can be incorporated this would be more uh you can say trendy also ? And technologically innovative also .       tomato red or whatever and second thing is cer certain standard buttons we should have , like for example , i if you see the previous slide uh   I think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this cer central pattern , here , so   h that particular pattern because i this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls . I can't see that , is that play and stop and things ? This is central one , the one you   So keep that m that standardised because that's the most common feature across all models , if you look at all the models , it's here .                                   selling point .     The L_C_D_'s not cheap .   well it's it's not as expensive as it would be if it was full colour 'cause if we've just got a black and white one , I mean they use them in calculators so .         Well you cou um .   No , one of the decisions we had to make was whether we had double A_ or triple A_ batteries 'cause they've still got to be charged this way haven't they ?   K no the kinetic ones come come with um a sort of w watch a battery that goes in a watch .         The inside components is pretty standardised across the board       The bare-board L_C_D_ or the well I think were we're going for the L_C_D_ on that one , on the buttons , on the on the on on the top one we're gonna yeah . On the top one   On the bottom we were gonna have the rubber , the rubber ones , the anti-R_S_I_ ones .   Um , okay on we've got the flip the flip-screen , the top one is gonna be the L_C_D_ and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons . L_C_D_ screen .               Plast right .               Kay .         and I mean , I'm trying to imagine um clean looking houses , sort of beige and black   that are more of a talking point than an actual clock because they're so interesting and       This would definitely be different enough , I just wondered if anybody could come up with something even more Mm . And you would just have an across the b you would have so many different options that you could do , you could have um a plain black one , you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little Well the thing is the rubberised covers are going to be s relatively cheap to produce , that if in a year's time we we get feedback from the design fairs that show something else is coming I mean it's so easy for us to just produce that and it can be slipped on , which is another beauty of it . And ones tha ones that have rubbery spikes y you know , you could just go so far with it , like a puffer fish , you could just , you could take it wherever , so I think that's quite a flexible thing .   Acupressure , you could talk of acupressures .     Yeah , yeah j with these rubber these rubberised ca not the actual uh plastic outside case , just the rubber thing that goes round the outside .   
   Mm , so can I just recap uh Sarah , for the decisions that we've made , kinetic charging , the watch-type batteries , um L_C_D_ display on th the top side of the flip top , rubberised buttons on the bottom side , we're gonna use fruit and vegetable colours for the rubber cover , the case itself is plastic .         Or maybe like uh William was suggesting in the last thing some devices you put on key chains .   the whistle ones , yeah .       'Cause I took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from y from y your report , it's not just a case of having a little R_R_ hidden somewhere , they do want it to be obvious that it's our product         Um , you associate the name with the individual product that it is and that does the work for you .     but I think it does , without that   Since it's the only one of its kind on the market it's obviously gonna be ours .
