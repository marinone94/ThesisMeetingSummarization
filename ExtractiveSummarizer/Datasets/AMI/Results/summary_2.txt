Help . Oh God . Right , okay um , this is our second meeting and I might be a bit all over the place . Um , right our agenda for today , do you want us to give you a second ?     um , we decided upon a universal control , one handset for all , T_V_ , video   Um , that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers , wide age range , not limiting anyone . We decided it was important to reflect the company's image in our product , we put fashion in electronics , you know that kind of s thing .              want it to look uncluttered , undaunting to the customer .   Um , three presentations , I've got written here so     Okay , yeah I'll go first .                   Yep . Yep there we go . Okay this is uh the working design , presented by me , the uh Industrial Designer extraordinaire .  'Kay , this is where I went a bit mad with PowerPoint so . What the first thing question I asked was what are we trying to design ? Well , a device which basically just sends the signal to the T_V_ to change its state , whether that be the power , or the channel um or the volume , everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the T_V_ or other appliance that it's sending the signal to .     I'm dealing with the inside really . 
 Um and uh I found out that most uh controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the T_V_ presumably because of the cost issue of uh something like uh the same thing that computers use , wireless and , you don't need to send very much information . Could I can I interject to ask a question there , is that appropriate ? You're saying the triple A_ batteries are small or the surrounding it ? Um no no , if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite the the well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones but I'm just wondering about power consumption and how much you need to send the data across . Um , now the ones at the moment are small Oh I see . Now the main components I came up with um were obviously the power source for the batteries 'cause otherwise it's not gonna work , uh as I said about the w which batteries we were gonna choose , we can uh discuss that later   Now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is sort of suitable for anyone who's watching the T_V_ unless they're in a cinema , which not most people do so as we're applying to the most audience that should be fine .     And so this is what I had as the basic idea of what we wanna do .   but anyway , we've just got the the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the uh U_I_ interface um  which would basically , when you when you pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of I_R_ data which could be decoded by the T_V_ receiver , which obviously means that we're gonna have to conform to whatever 
 Um it should should be different enough um from the alternative products to get a good consumer base , we were talking about it before and also just something that I was thinking about , uh because they're small they're also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of d dunno some anti-going down the side of the sofa thing that you could have , that was just sort of a general point there . so I can refer to that , whenever you like me to present .       Um , would you like to continue on from that ? Yep .   'Kay . Or , maybe move the laptop over . further .           
 Function F_ eight         Actually mm some of my points might overlap with what William's just mention , but basically my method was like uh whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which I think we'll uh take a feedback from the marketing because   So purpose , as William already said , I would put it to simplify the interaction with T_V_ to make make it as simple as possible . And to summarise I I would say it's it should be user-friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having uh a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel   But we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it , will this two features together .         
 Findings most people prefer us user-friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like uh people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons As we saw we we have to make a profit also Yeah , with that I think we'll be able to achieve economies of scale also , so we can give in add in more features and make it less costly . So in overall a simple and uh   Kay .         Oh , God .   Have I got to keep this here ?                 You'll have to push it a bit more . Yep .                       Um , so that's where we started , we used our our usability lab , the company's usability lab , we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public , male and female , all age groups from fifteen upwards and um we observed them in the lab , just their general use of the remote control , you can see we had a hundred subjects there .     Um , we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , we were quite surprised by that finding , but um that's quite a high proportion of our our , you know , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking .   For example , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot , so you've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel-hopping .   Um , fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , so again a big design issue there . 
 Um the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier , uh remote controls are often lost in the room , it's a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing , uh fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that . Uh thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time to learn to use and I think that ties in with the um the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons , they just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions . So thirty fives and unders who would like those two features , that kind of evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it kind of reverses , they're not so bothered with this .   we have new project requirements , um we're not going to be using teletext , um apparently the consumers consider it outdated with the internet now . our control is only going to be for T_V_ , it's not going to be a combined control , which limits you know all of the different things that it limits the cost for us , but it also makes it easier to understand for the consumer .   
 yeah , I think maybe Sky things like that might be incorporated into it , but It just said , for T_V_ only . Would that imply video use ?           If yeah and if you got if you got a Sky box , they have one of those plus boxes , you can record straight off the T_V_ anyway so on to on to like the T_V_ hard drive or so .   I think we assume that it's still got play and stop functions and programming .   Um we didn't really look into that but remember we found that finding that most people only use about uh ten percent of the buttons , I think th th those do tend to be the basic channel-hopping things and on and off for the video , fast-forwarding , so on and I think it's sort of general knowledge that people do find programming their videos a nightmare .       
 In fact I've just called up that table there , we asked those two questions , the table relates to both questions , so we didn't differentiate .           Yeah but um on on that again I just thought 'cause you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it'll let off a loud noise to let you know where it is     We do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves , so I think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing um because it is something I it needs to be the thing use to find it needs to be something that you don't lose , you were saying whistling , maybe on the T_V_ you could put like a pack on the T_V_ or something         something like that , but that's that sounds a lot cheaper to me .   That's a super idea . 
 Um the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset . , I mean what you were talking about with the marketing . Um , people paying more for it to look good . At the end of the day , th the engineering design is one thing , it's the user interface design that may and th the sort of you know fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world . So are we talking of a single model or maybe five , six designs ?       I mean inside they'd be essentially exactly the same .       What about you were talking about the buttons , um the controls that are coming out now have kind of big , rubber buttons , not tiny little one , big , rubber buttons , but what about , I mean , 'cause we got to make it original , 'Kay .           I'm thinking kind of Japan , I'm thinking uh young , um office people , trendy kind of a thing . Yes it will appeal to sections of the market def 
         But also er ergonomics as we're saying with the different designs , ergonomics uh there's sort of physically different things 'cause um if you've ever seen the X_ Box they had to make two different sized controllers because people in Japan wouldn't buy it because the controller was physically to big because um   uh just generally Japanese people have smaller hands     
 maybe a touch screen could be a better option for that .         all you can have a slightly bigger remote control and maybe in Japan and all you need to have a small , yeah . I think we have to design one product and then the company can take it wherever they want to uh in the sense that they can make it smaller , or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly , um . 
 Huh . Th the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same , yes , absolutely . It's gonna be the same , so we need to focus on just one thing , not get bogged down in lots of different um possibilities , um . I'm concerned , when you read the the R_S_I_ issue again , repetitive strain injury , I don't think just moving your finger around on a small screen is going to deal with that enough , I think that is still a kind of a question mark issue how we deal with that .   j I really can't get my head round this one , this may have to be postponed to a future meeting but it's something we should think about . I was just thinking about how you could combat that 'cause without without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the channel and it becomes yeah .                     
 If say people between age group of twenty to thirty five are the biggest market ?     the type of company that we're working for as well . That they want um it to be fashionable , they want it to be trendy and you wouldn't automatically assume associate that with the older generations .   business kind of class type people . I'm just thinking of budgetary issues too , for when it does get to the sort of broad scale marketing stage , we want to , you know , not waste money , not be profligate and uh 
 you know focus on where the idea will be taken up , first it's most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this .       because you've got your general record anyway so if you there's a programme on you want to put record on , that's fine , but if you do want to tape something in two days time       And you wouldn't you wouldn't need uh a whole host of extra buttons for that , you just need one 'cause you've already got all the numbers there anyway ,     It is after um if you look in the newspaper , T_V_ guide or any T_V_ guide there's a five , six digit number afterwards and that's the number you put in and it's recorded that it's going to be on on Tuesdays at ten o'clock on the seventeenth     Right . It's been been around for a long time 
 it's just it's not very well advertised as to how to use it and things .   Though if y if you've got something like Sky anyway you can just click on it you can just press the button on the programme once       Yes . Right . But just to have that function would be would be really good . Right . 
 Can I just run this past you while it occurs to me , I don't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another , but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me , to produce our own mobile phones , that that's kind of what led us on to comparing T_V_ remote controls with with their design features , um , chain companies like Carphone Warehouse , you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you've got any problems with it         Th as free as a free aspect of our service , would that not make it more attractive to them ?   they've they've got an obligation to to help you out and also I mean it's it's fair enough to have some sort of help service               I mean instru instruction books I feel c I reckon can cover that . 
 Instruction manuals . Department , yeah . Sure . Right . I think it will be too much of an effort for a person to for a phone maybe he might walk down the street , but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that . But we should focus on making the manual as user-friendly as possible because a lot of them are just tiny little writing and lots and lots of pages . Um , what other functions ? Mobile phone batteries , what kinda battery is that ? Puts people off reading them so they just do the obvious , yes .     they last quite a long time , and if you had uh when you th the thing that you get with mobile house phones , you sit it in its charger when you're not using it or t at night or something , but it doesn't really matter 'cause it never really runs out 'cause it lasts a long time once it is charged . Um , something like that should reduce the size of it . Yeah and if yeah if you if you had if you had one of those uh just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could uh Yeah it could be on that Yeah on that as well so . So are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote ? Yeah some sort of docking station Yes . So the rechargeable which would be your Yeah yeah th 
 yeah that that'd be fine , and also that would mean they wouldn't have to go out buying batteries all the time .   Yes , which it is cheaper in the long run as well .     w I mean so many remote controls look absolutely identical , these long , brown things with the same coloured buttons all crammed in on the s the surface . 
     What I was thinking of a design which Nokia h uh came up with almost six or seven years back .                 so we can have a s like you know moulded according to your 'Cause it's kind of moulded to your hand anyway . the way you h hold of it's kind of semi-circular in the bottom , something like that . I wouldn't say exactly semi-circular but yeah smooth . Can you look into the company logo ?       for example , if it was a C_ or something like that , you could have it in a vague C_ shape that opens up kind of like a shell , or something , um something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite         rather than like sea-shells , logo could become as you could put a logo in the corner of uh the model , rather than you know , trying to make it like a sea shell or whatever you were ta telling like .         h you can make it lightweight plastic , nice to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you're having to actually insert in between the two covers , that's gonna take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying p prevent a lot of that     plus you can get you know even though we're using plastic , you can still I mean think of the designs you can get in plastic , we can do a nice conch shell or scallop shell exterior .   
 Yeah we could look in at that .     So you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and       Yeah maybe we could come at some say five , six des designs and then choose which are whichever appeals the most like , that could be the most common design . But we can like think of five , six designs .         Right . Right . Right , so when they press for programming you it comes up on the L_C_D_ , a reminder about using Videoplus ? So that they have a look at the guide and Or was is this nothing to do with the project requirements , is this just that was an add-on feature ? It's kinda takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the button to press for the channel , things like that . Um it could be it c   Right . Right , so it's kind of doing away with the programming feature ? Right . It yes , it could be uh adv advertisement feature , um rather than design feature , you know , drawing attention to that . And it also paid um lip service in the instruction manual , 'cause it's very simple so putting it down in words should be helpful .     
 that we in the new new project requirements ?         And we've talked about um there being an alarm or something , a beeping for being lost , um . Learning how to use it should be as simple as possible . But there aren't gonna be that func that many functions incorporated into it so it should be fine and the I the instruction manual , I don't know if we deal with that , um .   Yep , and different from what's out there .
