        Yes . I think the Marketing Manager probably should go first , addressing the needs and desires . Okay you want me to start right now ? Well , could you um put my slides up 'cause I think it might be helpful if uh we looked at the slides at the same time .   You're participant four . I'm participant four I believe . Yes uh-huh . 'Kay . 
 Okay , and now I can uh full screen . Okay well I think we have introduced ourselves , so the functional requirements are is is part of my goal but why don't we pass right to the second slide . Um I thought that the method I should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody , and th the reason I just put that there like that is that uh in the init in the initial stage I think I should just be open to lots of suggestions . You know you can say anything you want no matter _ whatever you want it to do um and then as we go on what we'll have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to um design and budget feasibility . it's just something we can't do . So that was um what I meant there , and as I said on the slide there consulting the Industrial Engineer about that and the other thing is timing is really gonna be as important as money , because if we're gonna sell this thing , I think the best time to sell it is as a Christmas present . Twenty five Euros makes a nice little present , and we want it to be an impulse purchase , we want somebody to see it and think it's , gee I just gotta have that . And take out their wallet and buy it . 'cause anything that you don't already have out there in September showing it around , isn't gonna sell for Christmas . Um and then I'll be coming to you as the User Interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it and try to prior help me with that prioritising of uh of the features and of the the look and the colour Okay can we go to the next slide please ? S sellable . Yes . Alright I already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas and it looks to me that within the budget that we're looking at the uh the whole house idea really isn't gonna be possible . So I'd like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where I was saying we we could suggest anything . you know whole house control what'll be I have to wind up ? Um we have received instruction from higher up that certain things should not be uh considered . Um the one thing for example something to eliminate maybe that's the teletext , because that's sort of outdated with the internet , and according to to higher management the it should only control the T_V_ , mostly because they feel that it's too comp complex a task to um to to include other things , and they are concerned with the time to market . Yeah , sure . So I just wanted to interject this here so we're not getting too much off track here with uh with the things we wanna look at . other things that I found out on in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now . 'Cause a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use , and that was thirty four percent but even more important the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it's lost somewhere in the room . Kay can we go to the next slide please ? That is the selling point , the thing that's gonna make it an impulse purchase . Uh because once there's no be-back , well in sales they always say you know , be-backs don't come back . so they buy it now now now We have to have as few buttons as possible , because more buttons is more confusion , so that's why I'm saying , simplicity is good . So we've gotta concentrate on the features that help you find it , and I've already said this several times So it has to have enough value that when somebody looks at it they say , uh twenty five Euros I'm not gonna take that . Um and then maybe a motto , like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign . Okay that's uh about it for me right now . who would be next , uh , I guess that would be you . You want me to get your slide show up ? Yeah 'kay . Number two . Yeah yeah , uh-huh . It takes the power from a battery say a battery it it can be a elec an electric supply like you have and then um uh th this integrated circuitry takes energy from the power source and whatever like It should re re recognise the uh waves which are coming from the remote controller uh so uh I think it's hard to design a remote controller for multiple uh devices . Receive . Multi-purpose . So uh user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages like there should be a user user in interface like you know switch pad or something like that buttons should be there . So uh you can control whatever you want , you want to change the channel you want to control the volume or you want to have a child lock or you want to do some operations there's a there should be some device to tell what to do to the uh in uh integrated circuit so that the integrated circuit can s send the signals and T_V_ can perform the actions . So can you go to the next slide please ? So I I just would like to uh add some extra features to the remote controller um I think these are the very simple features and uh they don't take much uh uh much of the um um investment also they those we can make uh um like fluorescent uh they'll be like light emitting if it is dark so that you can find your remote controller if it is dark . And ther there should be a beep if many buttons are pressed if suppose a child is playing with the remote controller and a                 And uh different shapes that we can do like uh we can have you know a all animals shapes or you know comfortable uh whi which can fit into your hands   Now that's good from a marketing point of view , the fun the fun shape .           It just build a mould basically and uh you know .   As the budget we're looking at if you build one mould I don't think that's going to make a big difference whether it's gonna be square or Do you think there's any chance of um having ser in having basically the same machine with the same buttons but maybe several different shapes ?       but I think in principle that that would be that would be kind of fun , you know . Because we had something sort of sexy for adults and we could have something sort of silly for children or a little animal shape or in a or a little elephant so they can remember where it is . Silly for children . 
 Like an animal or Yeah , exactly . And and the butto buttons also I think if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons . If there are more buttons then it will be more complicated . but I think it will complicate the matter more Well , I think I think that that's something that we'll have to discuss um with the User Interface person because I think there's a lot of argument to be made for one button for one feature . people who Yeah , it's like you know Yeah , a little elderly , a little arthritic hand you know , and and it's a small button and and it they don't press it Something else . and that's the kind of thing people learn by feel ,                 and also text should be very clear so that there there won't be any ambiguities and         And uh display clock   I don't think it will take any money extra money because anyway we have an integrated circuit I think we can just definitely fit that feature into the circuit so it's   that's a good one , because the clock would be really friendly , and and when is your favourite show coming on and   Yeah , and we display a clock .           but you just wanna look at the news for a minute . Yeah that's that's good , the clock is good .   Uh components uh the main components we need for uh it ha like buttons and uh underneath that there should be switch .   Like uh we can have a bulb like whenever we are operating a remote controller or uh whenever the T_V_ is on suppose , then the remote controller should automatically have a b s light . Then it will be like if you switch on your T_V_ through anoth another source , not from through a remote remote controller and you you lost your remote controller         Um this is like uh when it is dark . And battery , there should be a battery for power supply , and a chip , chip which is like a brain to the remote controller which does all the operations , and wires connecting all chips , which is uh lights , everything , so there should be wires .         
       Um uh can you move onto the next slide .   Um I have referred the site uh the homepage of the um our website , uh from where I have uh uh I got s few points . So it um we should visit this site and have a look at uh what's up there ?   Uh it's not like that , I have referred the page to get new ideas or like what can be the working design to how it works and all and so and so .       Could you go back to that slide where she had that uh s slide up Betsy ? Uh , it's actually there now , there on the screen . This one ? 
 Yeah , okay , thank you . Participant two . No no , I'm three . I can make it full ? I did a little research to find out what are the features which a user would like to have on their remote . Yeah can you please go onto the next slide ? Would you want it full full screen ? There should be a signal uh something like a radio wave or a infrared light or a LED which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television if the user wants to uh change the channels or increase the volume he can change it . Now there should be some timer to set for viewing a particular a particular programme or switching on and off a uh a particular programme according to the user choice . Right . Yes . Uh t the remote should be compact and it should ha it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the T_V_ television . And um uh as uh uh this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of a T_ in alphabet for more compactability . And it should have an uh it can have an alarm clock a a person if some if somebody wants to get up at around eight eight P_M_ then he can set the time and it can be used as an alarm clock , and I don't think it will cost much to set an alarm clock inside a remote . Yeah , sure . And an alarm clock , yeah that should that should be okay .     So in even in the dark the user can know what buttons to use to switch on a particular channel . And uh uh the design of the uh um remote should be in such a way that there should not be any sharp projections so that if a child plays with a remote , he uh he should not be harmed in any way .   Next slide . And these are my few personal preferences like it can be used for a multipurpose use . Not , uh no uh like it can it can be used as a T_V_ control as plus an alarm clock to set an alarm a timing and it should have a child lock , and then to save electricity uh there should not be uh much s move uh lots of circuits and all that . And if a person if if if parents wants the television to be switched off by ten o'clock then it should be switched off ten o at ten o'clock automatically , so that nobody else comes later and use it . 
 and then you can use a timer as well . And uh what function , working design , how how does it work . So these are the two things we should come up wit with . So uh the first thing is pro maybe a little easier on uh who is our target group .           We have we have earlier it was mentioned about um for example elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands , so I think that's uh one group that's certainly important .       So this these are just some thoughts I have on it , and um I dunno what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group we're gonna design this one thing or whether we're looking at what we like we we talking about different shapes , whether that different shape also includes maybe different uh buttons uh for different groups . 
 Well you know there's the old motto , children under six never shop alone .           I think the children issue can be addressed with the shape and with colours . You know , like you make it nice and pink , fluorescent , banana colour or whatever you know for example you know .   That's right . You can make a banana shaped one . 
 Do we look at one target group ?       No uh generally we can we can design a remote which is mainly for people with uh f age from ten to um forty and and then we can add on uh specific functional buttons for children as well as the elderly people or the people wit with who have nervous problems , yes .       But in a family in a family there will be a aged person , children and a middle aged but they cannot buy three different remotes . They would like to buy just one and um just one which can be used all the three uh Children and everybody , yeah .   so maybe specifically you can design a big con remote controller for elderly and for children , like in a different you know .               The question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense . I mean the basic design I understand will be the same , but the question is how much will that set us back if let's say uh forty percent we make large buttons and the rest we make regular buttons for example .   So that remains to s to be seen but uh the target group as a whole is   That's right , and can we can we is it even feasible to make one one remote control with something for everyone , or would we have to use the same electronics and make three different shapes ?   And in that case we could probabl moulded plastic isn't all that expensive is it ?
