  That screen's black .     Oh God . 
     Um , right our agenda for today , do you want us to give you a second ?     um , we decided upon a universal control , one handset for all , T_V_ , video   Um , that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers , wide age range , not limiting anyone . We decided it was important to reflect the company's image in our product , we put fashion in electronics , you know that kind of s thing .     
           We discussed a flip-open design , um reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel um for further features like programming , things like that .   if I postpone that til later , I just want to get access to a little bit more information , is that okay ?                            'Kay , this is where I went a bit mad with PowerPoint so .   Well , a device which basically just sends the signal to the T_V_ to change its state , whether that be the power , or the channel um or the volume , everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the T_V_ or other appliance that it's sending the signal to .   But uh although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we wanna make sure that our design stands out and I thought that was something that well it wasn't really my area because   
     Now our one , I'm I'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple A_ batteries but those can be quite bulky I didn't know if you wanted to look at something else um so we could shrink down the size of the control .  Could I can I interject to ask a question there , is that appropriate ? You're saying the triple A_ batteries are small or the surrounding it ?    you can get the sort of circular round ones but I'm just wondering about power consumption and how much you need to send the data across . Um , and d which leads sort of onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round .   Now the main components I came up with um were obviously the power source for the batteries 'cause otherwise it's not gonna work , uh as I said about the w which batteries we were gonna choose , we can uh discuss that later   Now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is sort of suitable for anyone who's watching the T_V_ unless they're in a cinema , which not most people do so as we're applying to the most audience that should be fine .            which would basically , when you when you pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of I_R_ data which could be decoded by the T_V_ receiver , which obviously means that we're gonna have to conform to whatever 
 um whatever form of communication that the T_V_s are already using and since that that's another use and reason to use that infrared because that's what all T_V_s use at the moment . And then finally , um we want uh the it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost    d dunno some anti-going down the side of the sofa thing that you could have ,                               The plug hasn't come out at the bottom , has it ?       Actually mm some of my points might overlap with what William's just mention , but basically my method was like uh whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which I think we'll uh take a feedback from the marketing because   So purpose , as William already said , I would put it to simplify the interaction with T_V_ to make make it as simple as possible . And to summarise I I would say it's it should be user-friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having uh a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel       The main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top .     
  so it's not of no use of punching in the uh trying to put in those things in on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user .  so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production mm by fifty million we said ?  flip-top with a trendy uh uh design and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after uh continuous use usage and all that .      Um , I think we'll chat about it at the end , so if anyone wants to write something down that they want to bring up at the end , um           I think you'll have to You can't   
   Uh , whoops .  Bit more , oh dear .                     Um , so that's where we started , we used our our usability lab , the company's usability lab , we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public , male and female , all age groups from fifteen upwards     The overall thing which I've I've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , so it has obvious design implications there .   Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , we were quite surprised by that finding , but um that's quite a high proportion of our our , you know , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking .   For example , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot , so you've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel-hopping .     
  Um the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier , uh remote controls are often lost in the room , it's a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing , uh fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that .  Um , um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain injury . You know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems . Um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition , again that was to aid I think in uh when they've lost the actual remote control , some kind of speech recognition .  Um , that trend reverses in the older age groups .        our control is only going to be for T_V_ , it's not going to be a combined control , which limits you know all of the different things that it limits the cost for us , but it also makes it easier to understand for the consumer .   
  yeah , I think maybe Sky things like that might be incorporated into it , but                If yeah and if you got if you got a Sky box , they have one of those plus boxes , you can record straight off the T_V_ anyway so on to on to like the T_V_ hard drive or so .       Um we didn't really look into that but remember we found that finding that most people only use about uh ten percent of the buttons , I think th th those do tend to be the basic channel-hopping things and on and off for the video , fast-forwarding , so on     Ju um just as an idea on the uh speech recognition thing that pr it'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing and they're not that great anyway .   
   Would you prefer an L_C_D_ screen , that's multi-function remote and would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control ? So you can see how the the yes no sort of varies across the age group there , and a substantial number of don't knows in the older age group , I think that's just general fear of new technology .           
 use to find it needs to be something that you don't lose , you were saying whistling , maybe on the T_V_ you could put like a pack on the T_V_ or something       That's a super idea . Um the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset .     What is um attractive to a trendy New Yorker and what is attractive to a retired South African , I dunno , you get the idea . It's it's gonna vary around the world . At the end of the day , th the engineering design is one thing , it's the user interface design that may and th the sort of  So are we talking of a single model or maybe five , six designs ?             What about you were talking about the buttons , um the controls that are coming out now have kind of big , rubber buttons , not tiny little one , big , rubber buttons , but what about , I mean , 'cause we got to make it original ,   Um so you it's like a little panel that you touch rather than a button which shouldn't wear out as much either , not sure about the     Um , think that might appeal I'm thinking kind of Japan , I'm thinking uh young , um office people , trendy kind of a thing . 
  uh just generally Japanese people have smaller hands so they couldn't get round the controller which is uh so if you I don't know what 'cause you obviously you can have bigger buttons for some countries or something and smaller ones for others .           all you can have a slightly bigger remote control and maybe in Japan and all you need to have a small , yeah . I think we have to design one product and then the company can take it wherever they want to uh in the sense that they can make it smaller , or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly , um . 
   It's gonna be the same , so we need to focus on just one thing , not get bogged down in lots of different um possibilities , um . I'm concerned , when you read the the R_S_I_ issue again , repetitive strain injury , I don't think just moving your finger around on a small screen is going to deal with that enough , I think that is still a kind of a question mark issue how we deal with that .   j I really can't get my head round this one , this may have to be postponed to a future meeting but it's something we should think about . I was just thinking about how you could combat that 'cause without without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the channel and it becomes yeah .                   
 If say people between age group of twenty to thirty five are the biggest market ?         Now with the baby boomers , the older generations are actually larger , they have a greater population than us young people , but I don't think we're focusing on that , I think we are focusing on a sort of mid-range um ,   I'm just thinking of budgetary issues too , for when it does get to the sort of broad scale marketing stage , we want to , you know , not waste money , not be profligate and uh 
   , first it's most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this .     We could use that as an alternative to programming in times , things like that , is that I always found that really easy when I discovered it , um because you've got your general record anyway so if you there's a programme on you want to put record on , that's fine , but if you do want to tape something in two days time       And you wouldn't you wouldn't need uh a whole host of extra buttons for that , you just need one 'cause you've already got all the numbers there anyway , yeah .     It is after um if you look in the newspaper , T_V_ guide or any T_V_ guide there's a five , six digit number afterwards and that's the number you put in           
 No it's not um but I think if awareness was kind of brought to the forefront about that Superb .   and you press it on it twice and it'll record the whole series .    and they'll fix it , they'll phone the company , you can use their telephones . Is it worthwhile with with our retail outlets having a a similar um kind of service so that if older users were deterred from buying this , if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets , th you know   Th as free as a free aspect of our service , would that not make it more attractive to them ? But the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract so they um the companies who uh who you deal with have actually   and also I mean it's it's fair enough to have some sort of help service         Taking your T_V_ and your control and saying look this is what I'm doing , it's not working , what should I do ? If it was something as simple as you couldn't change the channel , but I mean for if there were any more or are we absolutely definite it's only gonna be for T_V_ and video , we're not gonna put any           
   Department , yeah .   I think it will be too much of an effort for a person to for a phone maybe he might walk down the street , but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that . But we should focus on making the manual as user-friendly as possible because a lot of them are just tiny little writing and lots and lots of pages .           they last quite a long time , and if you had uh when you th the thing that you get with mobile house phones , you sit it in its charger when you're not using it or t at night or something , but it doesn't really matter 'cause it never really runs out 'cause it lasts a long time once it is charged .   Yeah and if yeah if you if you had if you had one of those uh just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could uh               yeah that that'd be fine , and also that would mean they wouldn't have to go out buying batteries all the time . 
       I don't wanna big box with lots of things , you don't want a tiny sort of little thing either , because then you have got the repetitive strain injury no matter how many how much you try and make it simple , um     w I mean so many remote controls look absolutely identical , these long , brown things with the same coloured buttons all crammed in on the s the surface . We definitely an ob an obvious thing , a very simple thing is to get away from these brown rectangles , we don't want that .   What I was thinking of a design which Nokia h uh came up with almost six or seven years back . Basically we have a flat one it it looks like a box , like a chocolate .   so it's like uh you can say a banana shape kind of thing , curled up like a boat .                             for example , if it was a C_ or something like that , you could have it in a vague C_ shape that opens up kind of like a shell , or something , um something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite         rather than like sea-shells , logo could become as you could put a logo in the corner of uh the model , rather than you know , trying to make it like a sea shell or whatever you were ta telling like .     
 and that opens out into your flip-top . Then it's nice t to h you can make it lightweight plastic , nice to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you're having to actually insert in between the two covers , that's gonna take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying p prevent a lot of that     Less chance of it being lost too , it's not like a chocolate brown lozenge that's gonna go down the sofa   Yeah maybe we could come at some say five , six des designs and then choose which are whichever appeals the most like , that could be the most common design .   So it's no teletext , it's only for T_V_ and by implication video , our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control , um something about Videoplus . That was um in cutting down the number that was kinda separate that was cutting down the number of functions , making it simpler so instead of having lots of things you put in for date           It's kinda takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the button to press for the channel , things like that .           And it also paid um lip service in the instruction manual , 'cause it's very simple so putting it down in words should be helpful .   
     That's not at the moment a requirement , it's something we're looking at , what preference so it may come round to market research at some point to see what people would like .         But there aren't gonna be that func that many functions incorporated into it so it should be fine and the I the instruction manual , I don't know if we deal with that , um .
