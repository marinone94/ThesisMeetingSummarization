So is Why not save that .   Do you want to replace existing file , no . I actually tried to transfer it to My Documents , but Yeah , you have to you have to close that window . 'Cause that's the save one isn't it , so     Yeah , but I've ta uh right , I'll just re-do it .         You pass it round to have a look .     Um , it's almost curved like up to the main display as well . And the little line at the bottom indicates the bit the panel that you pull down .     We also have a apple slash cherry design at the top . Cherry would be alright actually . 
 Yeah , it's a bit more fun , isn't it ?     Yeah , and cherries are fun , summery .       It it'd probably have to be labelled mute . But um , we didn't have anything small enough to write .     For the first time , well it was hard to get the h um the actual labelling on the individual buttons .   Um , the important ones are the volume ones .   The mute could possibly be a bit smaller . 
 so you've got the volume in orange on design there , and the the channel is in blue . R right . And so when I done my thing on cost a I had assumed that the only uh button that would be a different colour would be the uh the red apple button . So However , I've now . Well the colours wouldn't like An important consideration . Right , okay so um And the second one underneath would be the idea for the     So we've got um detail design meeting .       
 So other than the fact that it doesn't have the second layer , but um obviously obviously it would . We got the buttons and the only thing that has really changed is the is the colouration of the buttons , and the bit after the evaluation criteria is uh is the finance .       So um , and then the production evaluation , as to how easy that would be to uh to manufacture .       Right , so uh as far as the the finance of it would be concern would be to make sure that the cost aye the production cost 'cause you may remember that was one of the first uh considerations was to be in d under um uh twelve fifty or two and a half uh twelve and a half Euros .           Do you wanna plu do you wanna plug it in into the the back of that one .   Kay , Alice .       'Kay this should be then .   Okay , so , by the fact that we've got uh the simple chip and the uh kinetic energy source , we've got a single curved           Well , originally , I thought there would just be uh one in there because it was the one red apple .     Well do we'll do it on the prototype , so do two , see how much it is . 
 Well , so we've got one special button form , which was the apple .         And the r I mean effectively we've got sixteen buttons that we're gonna have on there .   W I don't know is is is the sort of answer , is that meant to be all sixteen buttons , and therefore I mean , what's the op The option was maybe not to have rubber buttons , but just to have the one that was soft and spongy , and therefore         So you would only have the one special button that was rubber , whereas the rest would be hard plastic .       if we just had all the buttons as standard , except for the one red apple , then that would take care of that , I guess . We'd have one special colour and one special button form . And when I plugged that in last time remember it has to be under twelve and a half .   
 And if What happened ? Maybe if you just minimise that one in the top right-hand corner of the little box . if we just did special Sorry , you were saying that it would be that one , that you would put in one there . So that's nine point one there   So it Well , is it s is no , it's nine point seven         uh as assuming your correction are are assuming that that one change covers all the buttons , then that would be fine .       Um , I guess the sample sens sample speaker would be the voice recognition thing , which puts up to four ? We should be slightly over our budget but if we gather something else down to slightly lower standard , and maybe go with the one the special form buttons , then we could have the speech     Okay , that gives us twelve point seven       
 D wouldn't you have to keep the simple chip there as well ?         And go for battery instead . That would give you one less . Well , since it's the through the whole technology type thing , um , you were saying in the market research that people like kind of interesting gadgets in them . Um , whether they would figure the the s uh sample senor and the sample speaker , voice recognition be sort of a worthwhile thing to have . And then still have the batteries , or whatever they would prefer not uh         In a sense , at the moment , we've got a total which we need to reduce down by one point two .   Remember that was a minimum requirement .     
 Shall we shall we evaluate the prototype as we've got it now first , and then sort of make decisions about what needs to be changed after ?             But I do think uh the v uh voice recognition thing would be more impressive than the fact that it's got no battery .       And so the method is that the design team makes a prototype , and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we've formulated . And those ones are gonna be in response to sort of market research , and also finance , I guess .  And do that on a scale from say true being one and false being seven , so if it's neither true nor false , then that's four . So , I got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in a financial one as well , at the end .       Whether it's incorporating sort of the fashion element to attract the buyer .   And I have to go up onto the whiteboard and do this apparently ,     
 So the first one is um , does the product look and feel fancy . So if we do a sort of a one         a two . but I think What Is one false , or is t one true ?   One's true , and okay . Seven's fal Four is neutral , okay . So One's true . So maybe maybe a two . 
 Yeah , 'cause we haven't got the double curve , so we can't like say it's completely true .     Go for one .           So , false is seven , true is one , and So uh say about a two for fancy , you think ? Yeah , why not not , m m maybe nearer three . Okay , well d you do an average at the end , I don't know . Two three . Well , it's just that uh saying something remember that when you look down , we've got solar power , we've got uh various other things you could have , and we're not going for these options .         that so sh should we go for a a two on that ? 'Kay .   Um , deciding between the kinetic power or um the speech recognition , and if we had either of those for our budget , they both show a reasonable amount of speech recognition .           Like the power .           n't It's pretty The prototype as it is isn't sort of um fulfilling the 
 Well , wait a minute . The problem is we have to reduce down from there to get it down to twelve point five . And one way of doing that would be to take out the kinetic .         'Kay .   that's at the high end 'cause that's point six , whereas down at uh just special colours uh is point two . Now you're trying to lose one point two , so it seems to me that if you're going for the sample sensors speaker , you're basically then having to go for the cheaper options on everything else . And and the simple way to do it would be to have a battery , to have your uh sample sensor speaker , and then you're looking to uh take out uh point two , which would be come from the button supplements category .         Because we did say that we don't wanna follow the fashion too much .   And then it stand the test of time better . 
 If you have a in plastic rather than rubber , then that would uh enable you to get you could keep kinetic then , you could keep your sample sensor , and you'd be looking to take out point two . I think we need to think about finance after we've sort of evaluated that design . I don't know whether we're doing it in the wrong order or something or . Well , I suppose it's rubber as it is , isn't it . It's rubber as it is , yes .   We got we've we've got thirteen point seven     Um , for for innovation , so we've got the speech the speech thing , and  Mm-hmm . I would've said about a two as well . Yeah , two or three .   Two . And the next one is I'll have to get it back up now . 
 Oh .   Well , I can just sing about .   I would've said yes . I would go for a one on that at this point in time .   
 Um , incorporates elements of fashion to attract buyer .   Yeah , it's got the cherry and the sponginess . Say about a three maybe ?       Maybe two ?   
 Yeah , I woulda said two would seem reasonable . It's a two .     Uh the sensor using all of its all of its products , all of its buttons , and it's got a fairly big label on the bottom saying Yeah , that's a bit rough at the minute .         Does it fit in with our other other products , which uh are sort of coffee makers and spacecraft . 
 Uh , well it's got the same um speech feature as the coffee machine .         Maybe a kind of three ? two , three ? Yeah , two or three .   It's just that the pen wouldn't really write on that paper . I think the logo would definitely be recognisable . And it does have attributes that other products do . Two ?     
 Right , okay . Two .       How Two .     What does what do all them numbers mean then ?     is gonna be I'm just gonna do this in my head . One point eight isn't it or something .   Two . I mean it's pretty good at the moment , but it's gonna get worse   So should we get So are definite Was it thirteen point seven was the definite price rule if has .   
 Two b two b two , yeah .   Well , you can lose one point two and still meet the requirements .             Okay , so what was it , control uh F_ eight , wasn't it ? it's come on already .         So , you can see there that the If you want to keep kinetic , right , you've got a choice there of going down to battery , which would save you one .   
 the sample sensor and and sample speaker , which is your big item . Oh actually we just have a plastic case , then we lose two points , which gets us um           So that's eleven point seven , and then we could make sure we definitely had all the button supplements . 
 Different different colours , And that would allow us to have all the technical innovations . So we'd lose a little bit on the maybe kind of Do we actually have Do we just have one special uh special forms down here ? Well , uh w uh there was debate as to how you would count them .           point eight left     Now that would be one button , and the question was was that all buttons or is that just one button .       I think maybe the special colour , we've got three now just because the volume buttons are different , I guess we'd have the ones which are blue at the moment would would just be the standard colour .       So , special colour , you want three in there . Well I thin   you just need two for the special colour 'cause it's just two supplements , you know . One original colour and then sort of two supplements , I think maybe .   
 Okay , uh that's probably it . So we only ne we only need two for that .   The one colour's gonna be moulded out of a piece of plas uh of rubber , isn't it .     
 And we've got special form is the one apple . Was that the idea ? Yeah , the volume ones should stand out a bit . Maybe that'll be a second supplement . Uh-huh . I would have thought that's probably about r well . So I think that should still be okay . Yeah , that's twelve point three , so we're still       So decide we've lost a little bit on the fashion and lost a bit on the fancy kinda side of it , but generally speaking , we've kept the other attributes to the Yep . I woulda said so . So you'd maybe put fash fan uh fashion at three rather than two .             I mean it still seems definitely fit that p so that's like if that's the new age kind of um inno innovative c type company , then um having the kinetic feature and the voice recognition is p quite high up on     Like we got a cherry one . Maybe other ones could be something else shaped .       seeing as we've got , you know , we've made it a a special form , so And that would sort of maybe keep us close on the sort of the fashion type one .     So next year you could make next year's model the same , but have it as a a yeah whate whatever , a lemon .     Whatever fruit was in fashion next year .           Yeah , we've the main thing we've changed really is the casing isn't it ?   I think we've saved quite a bit because we've just got the push-button interface , which is by far the cheapest .         
 now s we now sort of got an extra form , and an extra colour for the buttons .   So , I mean we could maybe put two again on them .             And the speech feature . Yeah , the speech feature .   I think we've cut just about the same .   It's hard to tell how the rubber the rubber casing would really affect           But I think more the the features of the actual control will be more important than maybe than the the actual aesthetics , but   Um , apart from maybe doing the whole thing in the kinda light shade of blue , like the casing . But then what colour would you make the R_s ? just the the company logo .   Well , but you've got the company logo on there , which would effectively be a stick-on badge . So you're in a sense , you're comparing the product without the company logo . And then y but you've got the space for it to stick it on . Hey , what what what's the company colour ?   No , I just We got the logo off the web browser .   
 But but i but in the sense that , as you saw with um the Windows logo badge , it doesn't really matter . Fact , they've got black and white or black and silver . And that's actually quite a sneaky way of doing it . You could put in another Well , we decided that the blue ones were the um the standard colour . So you were talking about uh um We're assuming that all the buttons on the second panel , the hidden away panel , would all be standard . m may or may not be the case . Shall we save the point two for profitability then ?   Bu but but uh was the was there not a button that you were thinking of on the um on the other opt you know , on the second page , as it were , that uh you were thinking of maybe having as a different colour ?     Needs to be an enter button , but could just be the same as well .   
 Maybe for the the one they're gonna see all the time , we make it look good , and um , fit the kind of idea of what they want . I mean it's the sort of thing But if you're opening the panel and you're looking and you're tuning , then you're paying a bit more attention . So it may be sort of different colour buttons isn't so important . Right , so we're meant to finish up in five minutes .       Just made a load of money . 'Kay .   Shouldn't we maybe lose a point on fashion , go to a three ?     
  Well , but I think we said that w Because you got rid of the rubber , we put an extra an extra sort of fruit um shape on one of the buttons .       On the volume ones ? I think well , we could have lemon shaped ones with the volume ones or something .                       Until the design team comes in and says , get off . But you are the design team . Then we say it's fine , so it's all good . Saved two Euros on that . 
 Um , can I just check if that's a cherry or an apple ? Right . th     Just in case we need that point two for lawsuits and such like . Oh drats , I've botched that , haven't I .   Well , we're aiming for um one for all of them .         We haven't completely left anything out , so Yeah , I think As an overall product which has to be quite cheap , we've just about achieved     So do we have anything else to discuss ? 
               We've got the closing . So we've done the the finance bit and the Excel project and the We've done the redesign .   Now satisfaction with , for example , room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , means , et cetera , whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera .       So what did you and remembering that nobody's just over the curtain .       So , uh I think I have to finish that page .       So , um Creativity .             in be in-between the meetings , and they didn't the one meeting didn't always follow on for the other one , you know , sort of we had things thrown in at the second meeting where , you know , you'd looked at the remote controls and seen the curviness , but in the first one you'd also looked at some remote controls and looked at the buttons , and I don't understand why it would be in separate meetings that you'd do that . You know , you'd sort of you'd probably present it at one or something like that .   
 Then you go away .           Yeah , I suppose and then be going out and finding more information each time and then diff things will be relevant .       Creativity , seemed okay . Um um flow of information on on any given subject given subject um sometimes disjointed . I think it maybe could have been a slightly more creative project .     I can't think of a better example at the minute .   example pel to increase create Is this go It kinda kis fits the purpose that it was something everyone knows about and then something we can at least look at and think how we can improve on . 
   But think like it was a bit restrictive just to say that you have to design a television remote control , in a way .   I mean this one seems .   one of those things . Like uh , companies can have like a range of products and   but I guess that something got sent out and have like a brief to kind of But the other thing is that uh they're 
 I'm guessing that they're trying to use this um software to to demonstrate how you could uh do a project . I mean , m my wife at the moment , for instance , is uh acting as a computer um for um you normally , you got a problem , so you go to your tutor and find out information to see how to get it fixed . And of course , you had the machine crashing and various things going wrong . Well , sh we look at the last slide , see if it's got anything else . I think there's one one more to go . Alright , so we've got uh Yeah . I mean if you look at their products on their website here ,             Leadership , teamwork .   I've never seen one of them before .   voice recognition , especially not could   Well it's a different application of it . Yeah , so it's just like the same products , but just put together in a different way . so how do you reckon teamwork went ?   Yeah , I guess we all had separate ideas and then discussed them . To uh go uh reasonably well . I don't think sort of the budget um allowed us to do anything         high definition D_V_D_ and portable seven inch d um lightweight computer screens , and uh I'm thinking , do you know , one cheap remote control doesn't really fit in . Surely they they should produ So , we're m we're meant to comment on leadership and the means ,     Well leadership's a bit of a funny one , isn't it . But we can't really all fairly comment on leadership because you are the Project Manager .   So our experience of leadership wasn't really   
 but I certainly didn't get this uh computer to work as well as I would have liked . However , um Alright uh means , so whiteboard Oh . but Yeah , very nice .         I think there's a little there's a little um chi So it's not just for us , it's for the experiment as a whole , so There's a little there's a little chip , I think you must plug it into something and it produces a   Sh Right . 
     Whether it just produces a big image of sort of everything you've written or something , and Page after page .   New ideas found , so one or two .   what was the other one ?   Vo   uh , was it voice activated um       To fill in these fill in these questionnaires Pretty much .
