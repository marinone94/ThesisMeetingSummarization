That's nice . Okay so this is our second meeting . And uh still failing ?     Um important thing of this phase is that we're going to uh try to get an agreement about the user requirements , technical function design , and the working design . So that we can move onto the second uh phase . But first this phase . Um first an announcement . There's a little adaptation in the air conditioning system . 
 But it's going to be cold anyway , so I don't think you're gonna need it . Uh this time I will take the minutes . Uh you're going to have a presentation . Um and we've got forty minutes for the whole uh prese for the whole uh presentations .     So we've got forty minutes for all of it . So I suggest um let's start with the first presentation . Um who wants to be first ? Yes . Think I'll go first .  Just maybe it's easier if you um Yeah I think you will tell your presentation as well .    'Kay . My name is Freek Van Ponnen . 
 I'm the Market Expert . But you already knew that . Um I've done some research . Uh we let them fill out a questionnaire . Uh see what the market consists of . Well these are three quite astonishing results , I thought . So Um in addition remotes were not very functional . And fifty percent of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room . some things . Channel selection and volume selection um both got a ten on a scale of one to ten for relevancy . The power button got a nine . And teletext got a six and a half . So these are the most most uh important functions on a remote control . That's what I like to call them . Which are not really used very frequently , but are still considered to be of some importance . One hundred and sixty eight times per hour . Um Main characteristic of this group is that they're very critical on the remote control . They won't spend their money very easily . So Um the users of forty six to sixty five years cons They are not really very interested in features . But they do tend to spend their money a lot easier . And this means we would um have to focus on the age ages sixteen to forty five . Uh this also makes up most the biggest part of the market , so that will also be where our main profit would be gettable . Um this is certainly something to take into account . And thirty four percent thought that it was hard to learn a n how to operate a new control , remote control . So these are two factors that I think should be included in the design . Besides of course that the remote must look very nice . Especially the channel selection and audio uh selection buttons . 'Cause they're used most and so they should be robust . But it might be a good idea to make a docking station . And in addition to this it could um recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in . Then um a surprisingly great deal of people w indicated that um an L_C_D_ screen in the remote control would be preferred . mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five . but I think these are just some small factors we could consider . So anybody have um any questions until now ?   Okay that's clear . Now to the second . ' Kay .   Um f for the techno f functions uh of of it . 
 Yeah you can take your time . I think uh we uh must use the general functions uh of the uh remote control . Uh uh I've do I've uh done a little uh research on the internet and not much information about it , Uh so uh you've got a lot of devi uh devices like uh D_V_D_ uh uh television , uh stereo .     In one um remote control . One remote . Got uh many functions in one uh remote control , um but um yeah you can see ,       Um uh people uh don't like it , uh so um  Well what uh I was uh thinking about was um uh keep the general functions uh like they are .       Uh everybody everybody knows it so uh uh you don't have to change that . Um My personal uh preferences um .   So um Wh what I was 
 th uh thinking about was um you've got um             f the functions of the device uh for a D_V_D_ player or uh so um the pl   And um you got here uh real buttons for uh selecting uh a device . So um this button is for a D_V_D_ or So um for every um device you've got a uh a f a b a part uh display of a part buttons . So uh you you never got uh all the buttons uh on w one device .   'Kay . 
 Uh let's see . So a touchscreen . um uh use uh quite uh large buttons uh for um yeah . So uh we must keep uh buttons uh quite s uh simple and quite large . That was uh my uh part of it . I don't think so . Uh you got uh quite a cheap uh touchscreen . um it's uh not uh in colour or something . Uh it's just uh um one colo Touchscreen . Uh I seen uh w uh something on the internet uh not today but uh a few uh weeks ago .     uh twenty uh Euros or uh less uh .     'Kay .   Well it would certainly make a fancy design . But the It wouldn't be very robust . It's very fragile and you can get scratches on it .     Uh maybe we can first um listen to your presentation ?       
 Uh it's not too much . Okay I've got a presentation about the working design . Um first about how it works . It's really simple of course . Everybody knows how a remote works . The user presses a button . The T_V_ switches to the frequency , or what function it is . It's a very simple device , technically speaking . The power source . The chip uh controls the infrared bulb and perf perhaps a normal bulb . When you press a button you can actually see your pressed button . Well um I think we should use default materials , simple plastics . Keep the inner workings simple , so it's robust . in my idea , it's uh it's gonna be smart to invest in di in design and not in uh in the product itself . Okay now I hope everybody has a little bit more insight in the functions we all have and what we are doing right now . Um that's , we've uh got to design a um remote which is only suitable for T_V_ . Uh another point is we have to skip the teletext , because in the world of uh upcoming internet uh we think teletext is going to be uh a thing of the past . And uh it's a function we don't need in our remote control .     Another one is uh the customer is uh forty plus .       So we have to find a market which is above forty plus uh but which will suit our  uh remote control , and the other way round .     And uh we have to be uh very clear on this point as well . So I suggest let's have a discussion on the control functions .       And new T_V_s will have internet access on them . But I think if you're targeting people of forty plus , the chance that they will have a T_V_ with internet access   In addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control .   I'm pretty much against it . Against the no teletext ? Yes . Um Besides that , I think the market for forty plus is like pretty small . But I mean if I s if I see this , it's I think we're just gonna go for another forty Standard remote . pretty 
 No I think we can   Uh if we put a lot of effort in those , we can make a remote control with uh just two or three buttons . Or just a remote which is suitable for the market we wanna reach because it is forty percent of the market .   And um if you look in Holland at the whole generation of forty plus , fifty plus , it it's the the biggest share of the of the whole population now .       so I mean they don't really care   They'll just pretty much take the first thing they see and which looks acceptable .     I think that would be the case in the sixteen to forty five age category .   People of forty plus , I mean they want it to work , but as soo as soon as it works I think that if we're If we put our marketing right um we can sell this just like um I don't know if you've heard about it in the news , the the elderly mobile phone ?     
             uh that the new products we are gonna make , uh spef specifically design , are designed for uh younger people , uh so maybe we can focus ourself on the elderly people . 
 And I think we have to um see what requirements we need for those um remote controls .     But obviously the board tends to disagree . 
 No we we haven't voted yet , so Uh I think teletext can be uh       But um deaf people need uh teletext for uh for subtitles .     I think it'd definitely be a bad idea not to include teletext .       another point of advantage in our remote control , if we uh make a k a button ex for example for big subtitles , which is instantly on the remote control .       Functionality should be few buttons , you said .       But I don't think that's really an issue any more       But I mean it , if it's only for T_V_   You need a one to zero button , next channel , previous channel , volume up , volume down , and some teletext buttons but Yeah .     So we can s we can skip the display , so uh we don't need it . But do you need the buttons for one to zero .         'Cause if you should , if you want to switch from channel one to like thirty five , you don't wanna push the next channel button thirty five times .     Or a joystick like ?   Just look if you look at telephones . The Sony telephone has a scroll button which is very useful in searching names or Yeah .   but um I don't think there are many T_V_s that can switch channels that fast .   And I dunno if many channels would 
 And besides that it's um If we're gonna focus on elderly people they'll have to adapt . They're not used to using scroll buttons . the numbers yeah . Or there don't have to be a lot .     'Cause I think there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate a T_V_ , which already only have the minimum number of buttons . I don't think there's much to be gained in that area .   I think it's very important in the in the design . You can make a very fancy design uh with putting the buttons on the right places .   
 That is true but I think there's simply not much to gain on the competition when you when you're making a remote control only for to operate only the T_V_ .           'Kay . So we can That would that would cost a a big marketing     one of the arguments to make it only for the T_V_ because we didn't have the time to market a lot .   Instead of f of less buttons .   Well yeah I think , mean we obviously need a good way to position all the buttons and But I don't think we should spend very much time in that . 
 Do you think the docking station will It should be possible yes . If we have a fancy-looking docking station or very Docking station . So we're just gonna focus on the extras ? Yeah I think maybe we should do some research into what elderly people like to have in a   That's a good point .       Yeah that was what I suggested . it's on some phones too , which have a docking station . And you just press a button and the phone goes ringing . Like with your key-chain , if you whistle it goes uh it makes a sound . 
 So audio signal should be possible as well .     No . point is the L_C_D_ screen . 
 um I think we'll have to choose between the docking station or the screen , 'cause Which would tell you what it does . And it wouldn't have to be touchscreen or a very expensive screen , but Just the L_C_D_ . Oh just the normal screen . Just a small screen with two         But I dunno if that would As the small screen . that would fit into the 
 I think that should be possible as well . Um let's see what did we say . Few buttons , we talked about that . Docking station , L_C_D_ . Kay . I think that's a good idea as well , because um elderly people don't mind if it's a titanium cover or just a plastic one .   So I think we nee     Because are we talking about elderly elderly people or people from forty to eighty .   Uh what do we want ? If we want um a with uh for example the the telephone for elderly people , we can 
       If we should do something like that it would be a , I think it would be really good for uh for the image of the company .   If we're able to really bring an innovative product . Now you're talking about sixty to eighty for example .     
     in uh every country . 'Cause We've got five minutes left just now . Small warning . 
 So 'Kay . 'Kay . And with uh the little screen in it , which explains the buttons .   adapt it to different cultures .   
 or you have to put a language button in it , but that will be a bit unnecessary I think .         I will put the minutes in the project uh project document folder . 
 Um what we're going to do for the next meeting is the Industrial Designer will do the components concept , User Interface Designer the user interface concept , and the trend-watching . So just keep in mind the things we've said about the target group , uh requirements , and the trends which are uh going on . And uh specific instructions will be sent to you by uh the personal coach . 'Kay .
