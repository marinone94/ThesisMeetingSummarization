Right , so start of the first meeting .   so agenda of the first meeting . 
 We have twenty five minutes for this meeting . that seem sensible ? I'm Louisa . I am the Industrial Designer . And I'm Alastair and I'm the project leader . Alright okay , so tool training . Project plan .             Uh we have uh the starting base was the original which has been in existence now for a period of time .   to make the new remote control device uh more user friendly than the previous one , and to to be trendier , to be with it , and therefore to uh to get a bigger market share and bigger audience . So um method of doing this is uh split up as you can see into uh            better better inst implement than we had before . And therefore um have a successful uh conclusion to the day . 
         so everyone's to uh supposedly uh draw their favourite animal over on the white board over there .   So uh I don't know who wishes to go first . Do you wish to go f Have a first bash at uh whatever .     Let's see . Good job I got pockets today .                             because they're very independent , uh they're very intelligent , compared to dogs maybe .   Some people don't think so     Next .   I don't see as there's any need to .           I see if I can get across without just tangling everything . There's one .     'Kay uh pens are over here .   The three pens are underneath .   You get marks for artistic impression .             Um and I like my animal that looks nothing like a bear because um I dunno maybe because there's so many cartoon characters made up after the bear like the jungle book characters and stuff like that .       Um I'm gonna go for the dog , and I'm gonna draw one badly as well .         Um I like dogs because they're very loyal .   so whenever whenever you're feeling sort of a bit a bit down or tired , they're always coming up and they're always um quite excited . So um you can always have a lot of fun with a dog . And they're also good for exercise as well . You can sorta get out and they they sorta never get tired . And and when they're tired they're quite cute as well , so .             and so hopefully um won't prove too difficult to draw . As you can see that my artist artistic work is useless as well .   And uh one of the best uh things about fish is that they don't really take uh too much looking after because uh with most of the animals if you're going away on holiday or whatever , you've gotta spend money or get a friend or whatever to look after them for you . Whereas if you got fish , you just gotta put the food in a a a dripper feed which feeds them over the uh couple of weeks that you're away and uh   Other than the fact that they keep dying , uh fish are uh are not are are are reasonable pets in that               um twenty five Euros is uh the uh expected uh selling price .   So we're looking to sell internationally , not just in Europe . We're looking at um having our production costs limited to uh twelve and an half Euro per unit .     
 And so depending what the uh the overhead uh costs are will determine uh how many units we're uh looking to sell or projecting to sell at this point in time .                         and therefore uh won't get damaged too easily .       Easy to use .       systems are kind of T_V_ video combined now , or T_V_ D_V_D_ combined . And one of the most annoying things is having like five remotes in the house . So if you've got a combined system , it could be a combined remote . Or is it just a television that we're supposed to be doing ?   But it seems to me sensible , 'cause as you rightly said , there's nothing more annoying than having three or four devices littered about the uh about the room .         Um one of the things um we found from the market research is that people often get confused by the number of buttons on them as well .   And um sometimes uh they sort of remote controls defeat their own purpose because you're sat in the chair and the remote is somewhere else in the room .   So so I don't we need to sort of maybe think about how um we could maybe uh develop a remote control which moves around the room .   Comes to your whistle . That's that's maybe something for the future when you can talk to your television , but   You can't have both the th the one device and then have few buttons on it to 'cause you want you want simplicity as well , you want any idiot to be able to use it . Whilst at the same time you want , as you rightly said , one remote for all . And so these are probably mutually exclusive options that uh Hmm you could argue that experience of using devices and similar devices as people get more and more used to using remotes , therefore they're more with handling them , therefore you can make them more complicated as time goes on .               So it's possible that we could devise a system where where you're you're basically sort of holding a a miniature computer which is controlling all your your sort of your television , your stereo , and where you know if you buy a new thing then it sort of you can link it to that as well , maybe .     Um is there Next meeting in thirty minutes . 'Kay .         If you hit just hit return and it should get rid of the message .           Um if you grab the kind of uh slide to the left and pull it down ? slide four   
 Right .       For U_I_D_ the technical functions design . Marketing , the user requirement specification .   Are we all clear what objectives we're looking to meet in the next thirty minutes ? And I guess I'll try and write up some minutes of uh this meeting to uh to give it to you for the next meeting .     Is this a mun multi-functional one or do we decide that ourselves as we go away and work on it ?   Right . 
 That's true , 'cause during during the course of our day we might make decisions based on information or meetings that would change where we're going . Right s
