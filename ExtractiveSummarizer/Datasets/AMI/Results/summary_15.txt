Uh good afternoon . This is our third meeting already . Good afternoon .   Okay this is um the second phase uh we're going to discuss today .                           Uh did someone encounter any problems during the preparation ?   Uh these are the points um we agreed on . The requirements and the target market . Uh requirements are uh teletext , docking station , audio signal , small screen , with some extras that uh button information . And we are going to use default materials . Um does somebody have any comments on these requirements ?   These are just the the things we thought of , so maybe if you figured something else or thought of something else , just let me know .   And we're going to target uh sixty to to eighty year old customers .     So shall we keep the same uh line-up as uh last time ?     Good luck .   Kay I'm uh gonna inform you about the trend-watching I've done over the past few days .     And um besides that um I deployed some trend-watchers to Milan and Paris to well get all of the newest trends . And I've consulted some additional trend-watch trend-watchers , after the original trend-watchers return , about what the the best design would be .     Um the research indicated that that was by far the most important factor . Um innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design .   Um about half of , half as important as the innovativeness was   Um for our um group , we're focusing on the people of sixty to eighty y years old , this is um , these factors are slightly more equal . ' Kay these are some more group specific findings .   Uh they like recognisable shapes , and familiar material . And our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much the material for older people .       Um so this would mean no uh eye-catching designs .   So this would be very important that we at least include these features .   So you could imagine that uh the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station .       So it would be kinda more telephone-shaped . Um besides that we would advise um to bring two editions , one with a wood-like colour and maybe feel , and one with a grey-black colour .   People with more money .           
 Any questions ? Okay , we go on to the next one .  Um 'kay um uh some uh research uh a about um designing of an interface . I what I want to uh uh to do in uh our design . So um finding an attractive uh way to control uh the remote control . So maybe uh we can uh use uh that . So um findings . Um uh let's see . Just uh what we uh mentioned uh last uh meeting . Um and yeah overall um user-friendly . Um It's uh possible to uh uh to make um quite cheap uh system for uh speech uh recognition . and um it gives an um sig signal . And and uh for uh shifting up a sen uh c ch channel or uh for um uh putting out uh sound or something , you can uh just give a sign uh say um sound off or A I was thinking about the special uh button for uh subtitles , um just one button to keep it uh simple . Um double push push um , if double click , um so uh you get uh big uh subtitles , for uh people uh um uh which c f uh who can't uh read small uh subtitles . Um also we want to uh use a little d display uh for um for displaying the uh the functions of the buttons . And um we can uh build in a function f which uh shows the channel or some uh which the t television is on . Um See . Just um we can put uh the on-off button uh over in this uh corner , um almost uh e           So uh um and a special uh button for shifting up uh and uh shifting down uh channel , um it's uh on place where um the thumb of of the So you you can uh easily uh shift up or shift down . Um it's uh quite uh handy place . So um and uh all the f functions for subtitle uh one button , uh for sound uh       But if we choose for that option , the docking station would c become obsolete .         Uh as a case supplement , we could um , I thought of that l later , uh a rubber uh belt , like a anti-slip . Uh for the b buttons , we can use plastic or rubber . And the chip-set , um it says simple here , but it should be advanced , because we're using an L_C_D_ uh screen . And as uh the trend-watcher presentation showed , um people like wood , but it raises the price and it doesn't really fit the image , unless we would start two product lines .   
 And the chip-set uh really should be advanced because otherwise uh it would really be a simple uh remote control .  'Kay . So these are the points we have to discuss . Um first I think we can talk about the energy source , since that's um We could use the basic normal battery . You don't wanna swing before you can watch television . so it's not a very good option . And how exactly does the kinetic energy work ?           And besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete . And I think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we can um   get great popularity for our product .       Yeah you could load up the batteries , you could um insert the find the lost remote control function in there .       so I believe uh it will run on one battery for um six months or f or or more . So I believe one battery uh is just enough .   And I don't think they they like uh remotes just laying everywhere in their rooms .     
 That's true .   Um you can introduce voice recognition by uh finding back your remote . But I think it's um more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station . So you have a but button on your docking station which you can push , and then it starts beeping .   I'm wondering um what will the voice recognition mean for the production price ? Mm I don't have any information on pricing .   'Cause in our earlier um market research , if you'd allow me to go to the flat board , SMARTboard .   Well you can see here , our target group would not do that .   I would greatly advise not to do it .   
 But that would also go for the L_C_D_ screen then I guess . but this is here the question was , would you prefer it . So that doesn't really mean they wouldn't pay extra for it . And on top of that the L_C_D_ screen would um help in making the remote control easier to use . So pretty large . And um yeah I think the um Maybe we have to uh discard the voice recognition . So that brings us back to the energy . So in that case we could use kinetic uh energy , but I think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good . And much cheaper as well .         Just the advanced . Okay , advanced chip . 'Kay .   Um which brings us a little bit back to marketing as well . Uh if we wanna choose for wood or the black and grey . Um as we saw there is not 
 Yeah wood is a lot more expensive to produce .             wood-coloured .         It's a lot more difficult to to handle and to to get in the right shape .   Uh is it possible uh to make um changeable uh case . So um uh you 'cause uh Yeah with uh mobile phones uh uh so uh like the Nokia mobile phones , uh when you can change the case of it .   maybe it's possible uh possibility . So um um you have just to make one um standard um remote control ,   You can sell the cases . 
 I think that's a very good option . Because um then you can advertise as well with the Give your grandfather a new case for his remote control , or whatever . Yeah that is true .     'Cause we would have to make one w uh control which would fit in with a wooden cover and a   The more original one , or the more standard one . So you suggest we should design two different telephones       Well no I think w we should just , we should then just design one um   one remote , but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one .       
 Changing case covers .       Well the the general like most older remotes are flat , just straight .   And what would single curved and double curved mean ? Um it would just only affect the form , for as far as I know .   It doesn't really matter for the price or the functionality . So we can pretty much just do whatever we want . Pick one you like , yes . Kay .     It's has to be possible to stand up ?               What type of interface do we want to use ? Um maybe you can make a little drawing of it on the 
 Does somebody have ideas for a form or Mm . Uh we can just use the regular form of it , but it's um not quite uh fancy . Um you uh said you wanted to put the um changing channels button on the right side , so you could , so your thumb would be easily Is it possible to um program   And on the uh other uh uh o other side uh buttons for uh shifting , uh for for the sound ? For the volume . Um well that could Yeah we could do that but I'm not sure if that would be very good for the easy , ease of use . 
 But if we would make um a changing channels and changing volume button on both sides , that would certainly yield great options for the design of the remote . That is true . See um yeah .   For lefties and Can't we make uh Can't we make a remote which you can flip over and use functions as the normal one ?   Yeah if Let's see if I ca A blank one .   Here's a little L_C_D_ screen .     No it's not very handy I think . Because the plus and the min will be opposite and all kinds of Mm no .       But is it a problem that left-handed persons use a different hand ?       I think we could just uh leave it a normal shape .     In one or ano another way .             So this type should be better for you or better Should prevent repetitive strain injury a bit .   So th those are the three options we have . 
 'Kay . I suggest um the single curved , because maybe the curve is pretty good to put the the screen in . Uh you got like uh sort of a So um you want to put a display over here ?         Um maybe it's possible to uh make this side like           the right colour . Um bit like so uh um in the form of your hand . So so the remote control have to um lay in your hand .     
 And to put uh the the buttons for um   That's a good one .     So just flip it a hundred and eighty degrees around   If you can have this one , you turn it like this .       Because uh maybe your hand is in the way , if you have the display here . It's more logical to have it on top as well because , like on your mobile phone , it's always above .     Oh maybe you should just s start on a blank page .   Five minutes .         And then h the rest of the buttons over here .   
 Think that would be better . Kay . Supplements . Where's my mouse ? Then We've got a general idea of the concepts and the materials we're going to use . So now for the next meeting uh we'll have to look at the look-and-feel design . So the Industrial Designer and User Interface Designer are going to work together on this one . And then we're going to uh try to finish our project , and uh make a good design for all the grandfathers and grandmothers , I think .     or I think you're going to fill in the questionnaires first .     Maybe this one ? Then we can save this one in the folders group .   SMARTboard , there it it .
