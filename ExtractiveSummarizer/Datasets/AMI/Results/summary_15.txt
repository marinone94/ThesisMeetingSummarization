["Are we we're not allowed to dim the lights so people can see that a bit better ?"] Am I supposed to be standing up there ? So we've got both of these clipped on ?   Yeah , I've got Right , both of them , okay . Yes . 
 Hello everybody . Um I'm Sarah , the Project Manager and this is our first meeting , surprisingly enough . Hi , good morning . we will do some stuff , get to know each other a bit better to feel more comfortable with each other . Um then we'll go do tool training , talk about the project plan , discuss our own ideas and everything um and we've got twenty five minutes to do that , as far as I can understand . Now , we're developing a remote control which you probably already know . Um , conceptual design ,   'Kay .   We're gonna practice with the pens and draw our favourite animal on the white board , I'll go first , and um sum up the characteristics of that animal .   Okay , I'll leave space for everyone else .     I'm not gonna ask you to guess , I'm going to tell you that's supposed to be a tiger .       Kay .             Uh , maybe you can guess what I'm trying to make ?     It's actually sitting , so it's sitting , it's not standing . Okay , I see it as one thing     
 Sorry ?   Second it's loyal and third thing it's got intuition . dogs can som sometimes can make out between a thief and a person so basically these are the three unique features I think belong to a dog .               Well since you guys have chosen the ones I wanted to do , I'll have to have to go for something a bit random .   And also , my drawing skill isn't that great Well , as you can see , the quality of the work today is um       Well it was it was an at first firstly it was an attempt at a T_ Rex and then it sort of changed into a pelican               Beauti that's uh scary , uh strong ,       Oops this is now coming apart , let me just put the top in .       Oops , oh dear , what happened there ?   Hopefully that'll stay on , two-handed version .             , that's it's meant to be an eagle you can tell it's a flying animal could have been a seagull , I never thought of a seagull . An eagle , um again I'm thinking on my feet goodness . I suppose they're all so independent , I'd put that one down again . Da dum um .   A seagu right , not a seagull . Ah eagle , right okay . Eagle , okay .   Indepen independent , right , did you say they're good at golf ?     I'd say they're quite free-spirited , flying around everywhere , doing their own thing . Eagle . yeah , an eagle . And uh , birds of prey aren't they , oh dear , intrepid .         
 That was fun , right . Um finance-wise , we've got a selling price at twenty five Euros , which I don't actually know what that is in Pounds , at all . so that yeah about seventeen , seventeen Pounds , something like that .       Seventeen Pounds .   We can just refer to this later can't we ?   Havi having said that though , if you wanna get one of those the the ones on the market at the moment they're s they're about twenty pounds anyway .       
 so I suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price , we d or or is it going to make our product look a cheapie-cheapie option ?       half of the selling price is taken up by building it .   In our first year ? Yi yes , um yeah , I presume so .   just t we're not focusing on business market , any particular thing , it's everyone user-friendly to everyone .       making that a key point , just that it's going to be in the international market like Australia , America , things like that . 
 so we got one of the universal remote controls , um that you programme each of your things into , but that kept losing the signals so we'd have to re-programme it every now and again . Right . But basically on , off , volume up and down , channel one , two , th that basic functions , I don't think I could go any further with it than that , so , I suppose it's got to be something usable by someone like me as well . Yeah , the main that's the main stuff anyway , I mean and you don't want to I hate I hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do and just sitting there searching for the teletext button or something like that .       Actually that just raises a point , I wonder what our design people think , but you know on a mobile phone , you can press a key and it gives you a menu , it's got a menu display , I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful , so you've got a little L_C_D_ display . Right , I was thinking on the same lines you , instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user , may h maybe have an L_C_D_ di display or something like that , like a mobile , yeah and with menus .       
 You mean to save it lesser number .       So that's a problem regardless of of any design modifications you you come up with , that's gonna be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps , and that's another issue how we tackle that . Mm , yeah , the age gap . Yeah , what it just needs to be as long as it's sort of self-intuitive and you can can work out what everything's doing , 'cause I mean , menus on sort of new phones now they've sort of got all these pictures and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you're trying to do .   I d I don't like the , you know the new phones that have kind of got a Windows-based running system .   
           Yeah , I don't I don't know how for twenty fi , or twelve Euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get , you'd you'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white L_C_D_ thing anyway , I'd assume . Is it possible that that for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for large print like you do in large print books ? Obviously it displays less on the screen , it displays less on the screen but as long as they can read it that's the main thing .     In that you've got the basic buttons just for your play , volume , programme things and also and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures , obvious symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that .     It might it might save a b bit of space , it's i instead of looking bulky , it might look small . But it might have its cost implications .   
         No uh uh Um , right , okay we've got half an hour before the next meeting , so we're all gonna go off and do our individual things .   and then we'll come back and liaise again and I get to do another fantastic PowerPoint presentation . Just just a quick thing about the um about what you're saying about the uh does does it need to be fashionable ? The sort of I I had a quick look at the company website and it's like the the uh we put the fashion into electronics , so I think think the whole design thing might be qui     and it'd look quite good             They're kind of moulded and look a bit different , and the Telewest remote controls are silver plastic , which looks a bit smarter ,     Okay , so let's break it up there .   'Kay .
