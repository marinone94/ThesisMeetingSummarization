B	3.68	6.86	If you leave them on the whole time you get to look like a noodle the whole time . 	
A	13.41	14.14	Hmm . 	
D	15.11	15.99	Is that someone's ? 	
B	19.95	20.74	Is that . 	
A	22.99	23.44	Thank you . 	
B	23.936	25.26	three , apparently . 	
A	26.09	26.84	Hmm . Hmm . 	
B	27.38	28.56	Okay , you all switched on . 	
D	27.86	28.38	Okay . 	
A	29.06	29.63	Yep , me too . 	
B	32.72	35.52	I presume we're good to go . Okay , um 	
B	36.64	39.52	minutes um we decided to use a kinetic charger , 	
A	39.85	40.11	Mm-hmm . 	
B	40.93	45.64	standard chip , um 'cause it can come in various different sizes , it wasn't uh 	
B	47.09	82.47	uh gonna be a problem factor . We wanted a stand-by function . The case material is gonna be soft , rubbery , changeable . Um buttons with a combination of L_C_D_ and rubber according to the design . Um bright funky designs inspired by fruit , keeping with the hip kind of feel . Um and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that . Um and the rubber buttons that we'll use will be anti-R_S_I_ . Okay ? 	
B	88.58	90.29	Prototype presentation . 	
C	91.37	92.62	Is that for us ? 	
B	92.6	93.81	I think that would be you . 	
A	92.85	93.32	Yep . 	
C	94.1	94.48	Okay . 	
A	94.68	98.97	Me and William worked on a prototype , and I think William is going to make a p presentation on that . 	
C	99.49	109.822	Yeah , shall I show ? I'll show . Though do you do you wanna do you wanna sh do you wanna hold it and I'll I'll show you the presentation . Can I just nick your 	
A	100.76	101.1	Yeah . 	
B	103.25	105.86	Make sure the camera's 	
A	103.62	104.8	I can hold it like 	
A	106.05	108.224	Yeah , so 	
B	109.01	110.86	Yes , yes you can . Wait a second , I'll get it out . 	
A	111.205	112.366		
C	114.8	115.32	Whoa . 	
A	115.96	116.57	It looks 	
B	116.05	116.56	Um 	
C	116.55	117.74	Going a bit crazy over here . 	
A	117.88	118.82	crazy . 	
B	119.25	119.67	Okay . 	
C	120.76	121.4	Thank you . 	
B	125.376	131.35	You should have one of those things and you can just take it off . Ta-da . 	
A	125.65	126.23	Um not now . 	
A	127.17	127.52	Oh . 	
A	129.84	130.1	Yeah . 	
A	132.1	134.618	Oh , where are the hinges ? 	
B	133.904	134.72		
C	138.63	151.53	Okay , so this is our look and feel presentation , the final our final presentation . And we'll first look at the exterior of what we've uh come up with over there . Um 	
B	139.4	139.74	Right . 	
B	141.73	142.15	Mm 'kay . 	
A	151.2	151.91	'Kay . 	
C	152.77	202.59	It's gonna have a a plastic body um with a sort of standard colour , either we're thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something . This is underneath the rubberised the rubberised uh outer casing um which there'd be sort of a wide choice they would be attached , but we can we can come up with that . Um the um wide choice of colours and sort of patterns , so you've got you've got a lot of customisation with it . Um it's obviously an a sort of clam-shell design and uh the um the top L_C_D_ screen that you can see that would b would be sort of um 	
A	153.04	153.88	You able to look ? 	
A	155.57	155.91	Yep . 	
A	163.281	164.361		
B	168.24	168.62	Mm-hmm . 	
B	178.12	178.46	Okay . 	
A	193.591	195.325	. 	
C	203.712	234.227	how do you say , it's yeah yeah , it would be sort of inset into the into the top and the buttons at the bottom would d so so it'll fully close flat . Yeah , yeah . And working on the inside we've um already said d decided on the kinetic batteries , which actually , thinking about it now , could y could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well , so that you could probably get a bit of 	
A	204.79	207.981	The black and white touch screen wherein people can 	
B	209.05	210.5	Mm . So it's flush . 	
A	211.03	211.32	Right . 	
B	214.93	216.01	Oh right , okay , yeah . 	
A	218.16	218.905		
A	221.232	222.185		
B	233.26	238.77	So put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections , 'cause it's the top part that's okay . 	
C	235.49	257.8	Yeah . Yeah . Um we decided that um the voice recognition system , it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of , so we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap . So you'd have something like where you'd shout out , where where is the remote and 	
A	236.06	236.42	Mm-hmm . 	
C	259.11	261.27	it'll shout back , I'm here , or something . 	
D	262.144	267.296	Or something . 	
A	263.092	263.938		
C	263.456	318.36	And then yeah . It wo it won't shout out I'm here or something . It'll just shout out I'm here , or something to similar effect . Uh yeah , if it was going like I d well tha that could be something for next time , maybe . You can have a remote that tells you exactly where it is . Um the standard , there's be a standard transmission with the T_V_ using using all the standard chips that we've talked about . Um it would it would have obviously 'cause it's split over two two different layers , it would need two separate P_C_B_s , so it would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling . And uh because , obviously , all T_V_s use this , the same infrared medium , we'd just be using using the same thing to transmit the data . And the infrared 	
D	270.016	271.936		
B	271.08	273.5	Okay . I'm under the sofa . 	
A	271.77	272.07	'Kay . 	
A	274.29	275.32	Ah oka 	
B	274.65	275.93	Or , that would be too complicated . 	
B	291.23	292.62	Infrared . 	
C	319.88	329.72	um sender would be on the on one of the bot the bottom layer , just at the front of the we haven't I don't think we actually put it on . 	
B	329.09	329.72	Like here . 	
C	330.8	332.1	Yeah , yeah , something like that . 	
B	332.1	338.4	Okay . Actually , no , it would be it would have to be on the on the front . Oh right , yeah , okay , yeah , I've got you . 	
A	332.28	335.33	Infrared could be here also . Yeah , here . 	
C	334.2	336.51	Yeah , on the front on the front side of that , yeah . 	
A	336.48	341.96	. So when it's even if it's open here , the signals would go . Yeah . 	
B	339.8	341.52	It's still pointing , yes . 	
C	339.9	358.14	So when you've actually got it open , it would be facing the T_V_ . And then finally um on to the interface . The top screen , as we said , is would be an inset um black and white L_C_D_ s touch screen which yeah would 	
B	342.35	343.35	Yeah , that would make sense . 	
A	348.803	349.712		
A	356.66	357.39	This one right here . 	
C	359.3	390.89	uh have all of all of the the available functions for for the remote on it , uh whereas the bot the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons , like the vo volume up and down , channel up and down , power on and off , and uh things to that effect . And now we've we also decided on the inside , we could possibly either have um some some kind of sort of bezzled 	
A	374.192	375.858	. 	
B	375.28	375.7	Okay . 	
C	392.4	397.83	uh logo on it , or something inset , or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top . 	
A	398.96	399.715	Which is 	
B	399.04	403.037	But not interfering with the outside kind of look of the product once it's 	
C	400.04	417.09	No d not not actually . No , not uh interfering with l the whole look of the the product when it's uh on the thing . And finally that's how we put the fashion back into electronics , as that is that's the company logo . 	
A	400.96	401.28	No . 	
A	404.82	405.57	Look up to it . 	
B	405.44	405.78	Okay . 	
B	413.43	415.1	Thank you very much . 	
A	415.27	416.22	Yay . 	
B	416.53	421.99	Wrapping it all up , okay . Um I've now got evaluation criteria . 	
D	417.13	418.06	Well done . 	
D	422.2	422.74	Certainly . 	
A	424.26	427.56	So this is the one . Sorry . 	
B	427.07	432.17	It's to be presented . Okay . 	
C	428.81	431.05	There you go . . 	
D	428.82	430.87	Logged in ? Thank you . Oops . 	
A	438.47	439.06	Evaluation . 	
A	446.022	447.005	. 	
B	446.871	448.076		
A	448.34	450.37	Mm um I I think this is chip . 	
B	452.26	454.15	It's quite similar to what it was before , though . 	
D	454.21	486.19	Okay . This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research . So this is the first stage of the evaluation . Now , the collection of the criteria , as we saw in our previous meeting , was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company . So it's what we've discussed in the last meeting , are we actually meeting those trends and requirements ? 	
B	455.38	455.63	Sorry . 	
D	488.36	523.952	Now the findings that we came up with , just a recap , are here . The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel , technological innovation , it should be easy to use , it should incorporate current fashion trends , and those the two main ones , they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours . The design should minimise R_S_I_ and be easy to locate and we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there , though that did seem to be the favoured strategy , but there was also , on the sideline , the though of maybe having a beeper function . 	
A	504.94	505.44	Mm-hmm . 	
D	525.04	550.81	Okay , so we can come back to that slide , if you don't have a note of those . I'll just show you how we're going to evaluate our own feedback to this , to what we have so far . We're going to use a seven point scale , where one is true and seven is false . We look at each of those criteria that I've just mentioned , I'll call that slide back up , and I will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here . Does that seem clear ? Any questions there ? 	
C	543.83	544.45	Yeah . 	
A	548.5	548.84	Mm-hmm . 	
C	550.572	551.366		
A	550.79	551.82	Ah , it's perfect . 	
D	552.41	553.77	So we're going to look at these crite 	
A	553.36	556.21	Is it everybody is going to evaluate , or just the Market okay . 	
D	555.19	565.2	Yes , we're going to come to w we'll discuss each one and we'll come to a consensus rating between one and seven . Is that okay ? One is true , seven is false . 	
C	556.024	556.854		
B	558.25	558.69	Mm-hmm . 	
B	561.86	562.21	Okay . 	
A	562.82	563.02	'Kay . 	
D	567.17	584.48	Right . So I won't write all of that out again . It will just be criteria one , two , three , four , five , six , or A_ , B_ , C_ , D_ , E_ , F_ to confuse it with the number rating . B_ , C_ , D_ , E_ , F_ . This is where I realise how tiny I actually am . 	
B	582.976	585.33	Just write small . 	
C	582.983	584.179		
D	586.32	587.19	Criteria 	
D	590.99	592.05	and rating . 	
D	595.77	608.96	Actually , it might be an idea , if we each did give our own individual rating , and we could take an average at the end . How about that ? Okay . So I'll just separate the ratings by obliques , and if we go one , two , three , four , we know who's who . 	
B	600.78	602.04	Yeah . That works . 	
A	600.95	602.288	Yeah , so you can 	
C	601.0	601.69	Yeah , okay . 	
C	607.68	607.93	Yeah . 	
B	607.94	608.27	Mm-hmm . 	
D	616.02	631.41	Okay . Criteria A_ , the fancy look and feel . How do we feel about this prototype model relating to fancy it is a fancy look and feel . One is true , seven is false . My own rating for that would be a two . 	
D	632.52	634.48	One is true and seven is false . 	
B	636.928	637.65	I would agree . 	
C	638.7	646.76	Yeah , I'd uh yeah I'd probably put it uh two yeah , two or three . No , three . Three . 	
D	638.81	639.62	I'll just go this way . 	
B	639.49	639.79	Okay . 	
A	640.16	640.51	'Kay . 	
D	644.98	645.49	Two . 	
D	646.79	647.44	Okay . 	
B	649.51	650.05	I would say two . 	
D	650.27	650.7	Two . 	
A	653.088	655.22	I would say four . Mm-hmm . 	
D	654.1	666.18	A four , okay . Adding those up , we've got a six and a five , eleven divided by four is what ? Uh two and three quarters , it that right . Two and three quarters ? 	
C	662.78	663.75	Mm yeah . 	
A	663.23	663.78	Almost three . 	
A	667.56	668.16	I think yeah . 	
C	668.39	669.52	Yeah , yeah . 	
D	669.39	669.77	Okay . 	
D	671.92	679.45	Two point seven five , there we go . Okay , criteria B_ , criterion B_ , technologically innovative . 	
D	680.8	683.7	I would give that a three . 	
C	686.39	687.37	I'd give it a one . 	
D	687.77	692.92	Okay . Not that you're biased in that it the designer . 	
C	690.05	691.75	No , no , not at all . 	
B	696.02	696.59	A two . 	
A	698.92	704.29	Oh sorry , I I got it wrong . The first one rating , I'm sorry . Can you just make it two ? 	
D	705.32	708.63	The average oh , for you ? You want your rating to be a two ? 	
A	705.43	707.57	The first . Yeah , I I just it the other way . 	
A	708.98	709.952	Uh in 	
D	710.37	712.05	Is that what you're saying ? Okay . 	
A	711.17	712.421	Yep , I just got 	
D	714.96	718.0	So , I'll work out the average for that again at the end . It's a very slightly altered 	
A	715.024	715.841		
D	719.59	721.77	Okay , and we're just waiting for your rating f 	
A	720.69	721.3	two point f 	
B	721.17	722.86	It's just two point five for that one . 	
D	723.03	724.2	Two point five , okay . 	
C	723.11	723.59	Yeah . 	
D	727.55	730.1	Losing one decimal place , that's okay . 	
A	728.78	730.85	One is a , seven is false , okay . 	
D	730.99	734.05	So what are you rating for this one , Paw ? Two , okay . 	
A	732.46	732.69	Two . 	
D	735.81	739.91	So that is eight . That brings it down to two , nice and simple , yeah . 	
C	738.4	738.67	Two . 	
D	741.55	744.83	Okay , ease of use . Easy to use ? 	
D	745.99	749.46	Based on what you've said there , I would say a one , true . 	
C	753.08	753.41	Two . 	
D	753.92	754.53	Two . 	
B	758.53	761.58	I would say a two . I would say a two . 	
D	760.23	761.13	A two , okay . 	
A	763.62	764.08	Two . 	
D	764.14	764.55	Two . 	
D	766.42	793.0	I should've said a two to make the arithmetic easy , shouldn't I ? We'll just put almost two , because I'm not gonna get into silly decimal places . Okay . Or we or if we want to really bring it down , we can do later . Um mm now we're looking at it incorporates current fashion trends , now that's particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours . 	
A	768.224	770.091		
C	768.266	769.308		
B	772.44	775.62	One point seven f five . Okay , mm-hmm . 	
C	774.15	774.47	Yeah . 	
C	779.76	780.28	D_ . 	
C	785.53	785.85	One . 	
C	793.57	793.84	Yeah . 	
D	794.46	803.87	Right . So I'm just thinking , before I give it my rating , you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here . Is this actually going to be the colours that you would use ? 	
C	801.19	802.644	Yeah , that's 	
C	803.4	820.45	No , no , the the base colour was um white or or like or l sort of a light blue , but the changeable fa faces would uh allow you to get any basically any one of a number of colours that uh th it's full sort of customised . 	
A	806.39	808.61	White . With for the plastic ? Uh blue . 	
D	810.67	810.96	Right . 	
A	815.51	816.247	Any 	
D	818.61	825.85	So we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that's what we're intending to do . Okay . And the spongy feel is no problem with that . 	
A	821.44	821.79	Right . 	
C	821.54	824.824	Yeah , yeah , yeah and 	
B	822.51	822.86	Mm-hmm . 	
A	822.98	823.21	Mm-hmm . 	
C	825.89	834.91	No , no , 'cause th that's that's the the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put round it , that otherwise it's just sort of hard plastic . 	
A	826.0	827.718	Yeah , because you'll be having a 	
A	830.07	831.14	Because of the rubber case . 	
D	832.09	832.68	Okay . 	
D	835.01	836.83	In that case it's got to be a one for me . 	
C	838.01	839.5	Yeah , I'll give it a one as well . 	
D	839.38	841.39	Yep . Everybody ? Okay . 	
B	840.47	840.79	One . 	
A	843.3	843.81	One . 	
D	843.888	852.94	That part was nice and easy . Okay . Uh moving on to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury . 	
C	845.87	846.768	Yeah . 	
A	846.15	846.46	Mm . 	
D	854.99	860.08	I don't think we've really touched on that a lot . We've we've discussed it , we haven't really come up with anything that 	
C	855.02	855.73	Mm . 	
C	856.55	857.08	No . 	
D	861.56	871.78	we felt could feasibly reduce that . We've talked about pointers , but the very use of a remote control , if you're someone who's zapping , who's sitting like that , and we found so many people did , how do you minimise that on such a small device ? 	
C	867.46	868.03	Yeah . 	
B	871.36	879.57	Well the type of button that we're gonna use in the bottom half , the material , minimises R_S_I_ it's meant to . Um 	
C	875.92	876.62	It's meant to be . 	
D	876.07	876.4	Mm-hmm . 	
D	878.04	878.41	Mm-hmm . 	
C	881.472	882.736		
B	881.91	892.31	maybe because it's slightl with the size that we've got it's quite small , but with the amount of stuff we're putting on it isn't that much . So maybe because there's more space , it's not kind of moving around trying to 	
C	884.034	884.745		
D	887.8	888.18	Mm . 	
D	893.07	893.54	Mm-hmm . 	
B	893.13	899.632	hit accurately the buttons in between . It's quite obvious just big buttons . Um 	
D	895.2	895.62	Right . 	
D	898.06	902.94	Right . I think I'm gonna have to be neutral on that and give it a four . 	
C	902.31	902.87	Yeah . 	
C	905.59	909.653	Yeah , I'd uh I'd f I'd go for a five , actually , 'cause 	
D	908.14	909.58	A five , okay . 	
B	911.53	911.87	Four . 	
D	911.94	915.03	Four and a four okay . 	
A	913.17	913.62	Four . 	
D	917.63	922.02	Twenty one is that twenty one ? So that's four point two five . 	
A	920.112	923.27		
C	922.35	922.55	Yep . 	
D	925.61	935.61	And finally , last but not least , easy to locate . Now we talked about voice recognition , we talked about a beeper , have we really have the designers come to any dec real decision on that ? 	
C	932.8	939.31	Yeah . Yeah , it was it was uh a voice voice recognition , yeah . 	
A	936.01	937.54	Voice r recognition . 	
D	937.33	944.33	It was the I'm here thing , yep . And are we happy with the costs on that ? That is going to be feasible , cost-wise . 	
C	942.76	945.35	Yeah , yeah , that yeah , that's feasible . 	
D	945.46	950.29	That sounds good then . I'd go for a I ca we can adjust the volume on that , just as we could volume on T_V_ . 	
C	951.26	953.45	Um I think it would r 	
D	952.16	955.36	So if sombody's in the other room or if T_V_s in different rooms , or . 	
C	956.02	964.49	I think it would probably be a a stand it would be a stand it would be quite loud . So it would be s p yeah . 	
B	958.22	959.02	A standard . 	
B	961.48	962.09	It would be . 	
D	961.68	964.49	Right . Okay . You built into the feature . 	
B	963.83	968.45	And if you didn't hear it in the room that you were standing in , then you'd realise that it wasn't in that room , you'd go into another room . 	
D	967.33	967.76	Okay . 	
C	968.07	968.29	Yeah . 	
D	968.99	971.57	Logical . That's a one for me . 	
C	971.536	973.08	Yeah , one . 	
D	972.8	975.64	One and one , good . 	
B	973.73	973.97	One . 	
A	974.286	974.877		
A	975.77	976.639		
C	976.805	982.506	I do realise that we might be being fairly biased , 'cause it is our product , but 	
D	980.736	1019.58	So , how do we feel about this ? We've got our our we've got the highest rating of meeting the specifications that is definitely true for two of the uh six criteria there . That is for um incorporates current fashion trends and is easy to locate . The lowest rating we've got , which is really n it's not terribly low , i it's close around neutral is for uh the minimisation of repetitive strain injury . Do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it , or do we have to make further modifications ? 	
B	980.842	982.112		
A	981.369	982.174		
C	986.058	987.072		
C	999.333	1000.011		
B	1021.4	1022.18	I don't think so . 	
C	1022.9	1026.04	W I thin yeah , I think yeah . 	
D	1023.43	1024.4	We happy to go ahead ? 	
B	1024.31	1026.27	I think we yeah . I think we're set . 	
D	1025.62	1032.01	Yeah . I think for most of those ratings that it's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that , and I really doubt if 	
D	1033.08	1039.46	on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities , we could actually do much more to minimise that . 	
B	1037.85	1040.4	Do much apart from having a huge big 	
C	1039.24	1039.86	Mm . 	
D	1040.36	1048.17	I know . Okay . Well , I hope that's uh clear to the team . Is there anything you would like to to ask me about the findings before I 	
D	1049.28	1049.65	sum up ? 	
B	1050.24	1050.81	Don't think so . 	
C	1050.44	1050.72	No . 	
D	1050.9	1055.9	Good . Fine then . I'll just leave it there . Oops . 	
B	1054.34	1055.66	Okay , thank you . 	
B	1063.83	1070.59	Okay , I've got finance here now . I'm gonna plug this in so you can all see it , if that's okay . 	
A	1064.69	1065.23	Hmm . 	
B	1072.23	1072.6	Um . 	
D	1072.25	1072.91	Oh yes . 	
A	1078.78	1080.04	You want me to b unplug that ? 	
C	1080.368	1082.174		
C	1092.142	1093.333		
A	1096.55	1097.68	That's all . Yes . 	
B	1098.28	1098.81	Thanks . 	
B	1108.89	1109.31	Right . 	
A	1110.38	1111.03	Okay . 	
B	1112.62	1113.73	Now I presume 	
B	1115.56	1116.72	that the screen will go blank , 	
C	1116.946	1117.954		
B	1117.91	1119.632	that um 	
B	1126.0	1134.85	Okay . We just type numbers into this and we come out with the final value . So are we still on for kinetic ? 	
C	1135.1	1135.43	Yeah . 	
D	1135.45	1135.7	Yes . 	
B	1136.15	1142.17	Okay . See , it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning . Um it might have influenced our choice . 	
B	1145.1	1147.89	Right , what's happening with the electronics ? 	
C	1148.35	1151.872	It was a regular chip on print and 	
A	1150.01	1150.8	Chip on print . 	
B	1157.94	1158.87	Double-curved . 	
C	1158.1	1159.648	Oh , no , no , no , the um 	
C	1161.34	1166.78	Yeah , it's you you've put in three for the number of kinetic cells , there should just be one . 	
C	1168.02	1171.13	In the top , it's the number of c yeah . 	
B	1169.94	1171.2	Oh , right , okay . 	
B	1172.39	1172.95	Thanks . 	
C	1174.66	1179.552	Yeah , and yeah , just a no , one reg v uh 	
B	1175.2	1176.28	So , would there be two ? 	
B	1179.73	1180.28	One chip . 	
C	1180.64	1183.66	Yeah , one of them and one sample sensor and sample speaker . 	
A	1183.43	1183.92	Okay . 	
B	1183.81	1184.37	Okay . 	
A	1187.64	1188.14	Yep . 	
C	1188.18	1191.46	And they're double curved . No . Y 	
A	1190.93	1192.08	Single-curved . 	
B	1191.3	1192.11	One double curve . 	
C	1192.93	1194.43	Two , 'cause it's two . 	
A	1193.71	1194.32	Two curves , yeah . 	
D	1194.81	1197.69	But it has a slightly flattened bottom so it can sit . So it can rest . 	
B	1197.3	1198.68	So what's a single curve then ? 	
C	1198.5	1202.576	Yeah , I'd say I'd say it was w yeah , I think I think it's 	
D	1199.33	1202.83	It would just be a flat bottom with one curve . like a domed thing . 	
B	1202.88	1204.382	So just one double 	
A	1202.99	1203.67	Single-cu 	
D	1204.42	1204.71	Mm . 	
C	1204.64	1205.74	One double-curved . 	
B	1205.48	1207.822	Yeah . Um 	
A	1205.984	1206.434	. 	
C	1206.93	1211.71	And one no , 'cause one yeah , one's double-curved , and then the other one's 	
A	1207.73	1208.65	Plastic and rubber . 	
D	1210.63	1214.24	The other curves at the sides , but it's slightly flattened at the bottom so it doesn't roll over . Yeah . 	
B	1213.85	1214.2	Mm . 	
B	1216.448	1220.35	Um we've got plastic and rubber , haven't we ? 	
C	1217.76	1218.46	a plastic . 	
C	1220.58	1220.8	Yeah . 	
A	1221.03	1224.45	Yeah . Plastic one and maybe rubber point five . 	
C	1223.18	1224.13	And special colour . 	
B	1223.761	1225.458	. 	
A	1227.56	1230.99	No I think rubber , since it's being used just as a casing , we can put point five . 	
B	1227.88	1228.176	Um 	
C	1232.31	1233.05	Yeah . 	
B	1232.9	1233.29	Do you think ? 	
A	1233.49	1234.432	Yeah , because there are 	
A	1235.49	1238.94	I think it allows the point five , yeah . We can use that . 	
C	1239.12	1239.8	Yeah . 	
B	1239.32	1239.72	Okay . 	
D	1240.69	1242.47	What does it mean if you put point five for that ? 	
A	1242.52	1245.36	It means we are not using a lot of rubber actually . We're using just 	
B	1244.84	1246.48	It would be like saying we're using 	
A	1246.79	1249.56	a very low quantity of rubber compared to plastic . 	
B	1250.74	1252.62	See , it says case material . 	
D	1253.4	1253.76	Mm-hmm . 	
B	1253.86	1260.08	So we're not actually using plastic in the case , are we ? It's including , it's including . 	
C	1257.14	1259.31	No , no , that's it's as an extra . 	
D	1259.48	1260.93	Right , okay . 	
C	1260.45	1266.79	So that shouldn't that shouldn't be actually on there , because that's not incorporated in the cost of the remote you get . 	
D	1267.28	1276.76	But it is gonna be part of the total cost , and there's nowhere else we can we can put that in , is there ? There's nowhere else we can code for the the rubber used in the casing . So do we not have to account for it in the cost somewhere there ? 	
C	1271.729	1272.463		
B	1278.4	1281.24	Okay , we'll just put it in as we'll put in as half . 	
D	1281.25	1281.47	Okay . 	
B	1283.57	1286.37	Or sh we should just put it in as one , because the plastic is zero anyway . 	
C	1286.34	1287.64	Yeah , okay . 	
D	1286.7	1286.94	Mm . 	
B	1289.38	1293.94	No , we don't step on anyone's toes . Okay , special colour , do we need that ? 	
D	1294.34	1299.35	Might do , if we go for some of the more exotic aubergines and such like colours . 	
B	1296.43	1297.35	N yeah , okay . 	
B	1300.336	1301.53	Interface . 	
A	1302.12	1302.72	Push-button . 	
C	1304.21	1308.25	Yeah , the push-button's one and L_C_ display one . 	
A	1304.99	1305.32	One . 	
A	1306.94	1307.42	An 	
A	1309.63	1310.08	One . 	
C	1311.34	1312.278	And buttons 	
B	1311.8	1312.183	Buttons 	
D	1370.74	1370.87	S 	
A	1371.748	1375.94	I think we could change the battery also . Instead of going for kinetic how about going for a standard battery . 	
D	1377.35	1383.83	Has that not made any d if you click off that square now , has that not made any difference ? Is it oh , it's brought it slightly down . 	
C	1382.03	1383.12	Well yes . 	
B	1382.35	1386.73	Has that not gone up ? Oh no , it was seven five it's changed not a lot . 	
D	1386.26	1391.26	So is is uncurved completely and just actually making the rubber case the curved thing , is that going to make a difference ? 	
C	1390.02	1390.32	Yeah . 	
A	1391.61	1392.63	Uncurved , flat . 	
B	1393.312	1393.616		
D	1395.63	1398.59	Oh , it's not made any difference , has it? . It's gone up again . 	
C	1397.52	1398.579	No , we'll have 	
A	1397.89	1399.6	No , it just surprises one . 	
B	1398.63	1400.57	Oh , it's not calculated it . 	
C	1399.38	1402.07	No , no , you've got to click off to calculate it again . 	
D	1400.02	1400.28	Oh . 	
B	1402.8	1403.55	Okay , there we go . 	
D	1403.467	1405.07	It's brought it down slightly . 	
B	1404.345	1406.39	It's not a lot though . 	
C	1405.18	1420.12	C it might uh you might you might be assuming that that is in Euros . It could be in Dollars . And then it would be fine , because the exchange range would make it about twelve . No . 	
A	1405.422	1407.516	. 	
A	1415.679	1417.6	I don't think so . 	
D	1416.36	1417.734	Is there anything on the menu 	
B	1416.42	1419.569	We haven't been dealin we haven't been dealing with dollars though , I think 	
D	1418.58	1418.85	No . 	
A	1419.89	1421.14	Ri I think it's in Euro . 	
B	1421.12	1424.0	Okay , so the highest we've got is the electronics here . 	
B	1425.41	1426.01	Um 	
B	1427.236	1429.45	and the interface . 	
D	1427.47	1428.8	If we tr um . 	
D	1429.88	1436.45	If we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries , would that make a huge difference ? 	
A	1433.73	1435.11	And going to a regular bat 	
C	1436.48	1443.248	Yeah , the standard , it um it would make one difference . The biggest one would be taking away if you took away 	
A	1436.81	1437.0	Yeah . 	
A	1444.22	1452.09	What I feel is , customers never said anything about the battery . It's internal , nobody looks into the battery . But shape and colours , that's something we shouldn't comprimi 	
C	1445.43	1445.79	If you to 	
C	1448.55	1448.92	Yeah . 	
D	1450.29	1455.09	And people are used to buying batteries , they're not gonna say I'm not getting this , 'cause I've got to buy a battery for a remote control . 	
C	1450.99	1457.18	If if you take away the voice , I I do I don't like to say it , but if you take away the voice recognition , then you've got it . 	
A	1458.66	1460.22	Where's that special form ? 	
A	1461.33	1463.05	Mm mm mm . 	
D	1461.66	1463.38	Should we see what difference it makes ? 	
B	1462.96	1463.49	Where's the 	
C	1463.47	1472.06	Yeah i yeah . No 'cause it's samples sens sample speaker . If you took away that , that'll make it twelve point three five . 	
B	1464.44	1465.67	where's the voice recognition ? 	
D	1464.5	1464.974	Um 	
B	1468.64	1469.56	Right , okay . 	
B	1472.12	1476.41	Well the kinetic is three . If we change it to the battery it's that's minus three . 	
C	1475.4	1480.15	They n n yeah , but you p minus three plus two . 	
B	1480.23	1482.41	Oh , right . I keep seeing zero . 	
B	1483.56	1484.32	Um 	
B	1488.688	1502.18	We can do it some other way , we can do it doesn't have to be voice recognition . We could do the voice recognition for , you know , business class or something , you know , like an upgraded version . You could choose to have that or not . 	
A	1489.094	1491.044		
D	1497.73	1498.0	Yeah . 	
C	1499.76	1511.32	Yeah . But they but I mean in I don't see why we have to sell it for twenty five Euros now , because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product . 	
D	1499.95	1500.28	Sure . 	
A	1500.31	1500.59	Mm-hmm . 	
D	1511.8	1514.59	But we're still working to um head o 	
B	1513.26	1516.853	So should we just change the design specification then ? 	
A	1515.582	1517.53	Make it costly . 	
D	1515.68	1544.912	We can put in our recommendations . If we if we're working to head office specifications as this is what this project team's working for , we can put in our recommendations for what we've we've found and what we the consensus that we've come to as a result of the meetings . But we need to work to that specification to start with . And I think the voice recognition sounds wonderful , but our object is so distinctive that that in itself is gonna make it easier to locate as a f you know in a first instance . Um as you say , we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers and so 	
B	1517.91	1518.33	Yes . 	
C	1522.07	1522.46	Yeah . 	
B	1526.76	1527.14	Mm-hmm . 	
C	1526.84	1528.56	We c we could s 	
C	1530.05	1531.28	Yeah , we could say 	
B	1530.07	1530.52	Mm-hmm . 	
B	1544.93	1546.05	Okay , we can 	
C	1547.13	1547.72	Yeah , I s 	
B	1547.48	1564.672	make the price fit , and then say if we'd had our budget , we would've had this , because it also sets it apart from the crowd . They like their gadgets , they like something that's completely different . It's s something completely different associated with your company . Right , okay , so 	
C	1549.97	1552.032	And then say we recommend 	
D	1552.07	1552.46	Mm . 	
C	1553.35	1553.61	Yeah . 	
D	1553.38	1553.63	Yeah . 	
D	1555.06	1557.99	'Cause we've done all the background work to go for that if they want it . 	
C	1559.56	1559.83	Yeah . 	
D	1560.27	1560.84	Yeah . 	
D	1565.4	1567.968	So if we take voice recognition out 	
C	1567.94	1576.88	That'll do it . Twelve point three five . Is it twelve point fif was it twelve point fifty ? 	
A	1572.23	1573.5	Yeah we are close to the budget . 	
D	1572.58	1573.21	we are . 	
A	1575.01	1575.89	Two five . 	
B	1575.05	1579.07	It's two point five . No , it's twelve point two five . 	
D	1579.89	1582.61	Are you sure ? Sorry , not meaning to doubt your words there . 	
B	1581.9	1584.82	Yeah well two , twelve point two five times two is 	
D	1586.28	1589.64	Right . Are they really going to quibble about ten P_ ? 	
B	1586.69	1588.15	twenty five , isn't it ? 	
A	1588.0	1589.33	It's twelve point five maybe , then . 	
D	1591.45	1595.66	Or point zero one of a Euro ? Which is less than ten P_ . 	
A	1601.5	1606.474	I don't know what it said fifty percent of the cost . So half of the price would be 	
B	1604.636	1608.67	I think the agenda one was where the um price was , wasn't it ? No . 	
A	1612.95	1613.88	I think it is the first one . 	
D	1614.53	1615.34	That's today's 	
D	1619.4	1620.69	kick off meeting , . 	
B	1622.62	1623.38	Twelve point five . 	
D	1623.7	1626.18	Mm . I thought that's what it was . 	
C	1624.27	1625.13	Ah . 	
B	1624.291	1625.264		
A	1624.72	1626.1	So we are under the budget . 	
B	1626.45	1627.2	Well done , people . 	
D	1627.91	1628.73	So we're okay . 	
C	1630.55	1632.17	Okay . 	
B	1630.89	1637.26	So is that uh got us covered for the electronics then ? We don't need something else to take that place ? Okay . 	
C	1634.52	1634.81	Yeah . 	
C	1636.26	1642.24	No . 'Cause that that was just a bought-on extra , you could just take that out 	
C	1643.77	1645.35	and that would be fine , yeah . 	
B	1644.706	1645.48	Okay . 	
A	1653.17	1653.75	Seems fine . 	
C	1655.05	1655.98	Yeah , I think that's brilliant . 	
A	1655.8	1658.07	Except voice recognition , everything is 	
B	1657.33	1659.21	Right , so we've done that . 	
B	1662.03	1665.61	Okay . Product evaluation . 	
B	1666.92	1675.74	We've done room for creativity , haven't we ? Because we've got decisions that we would have made that we weren't didn't feel able to make . Um 	
C	1669.25	1669.56	Yeah . 	
A	1669.66	1669.97	Yeah . 	
B	1677.48	1679.97	I presume we discussed leadership and teamwork . 	
A	1680.41	1680.67	Mm-hmm . 	
C	1683.69	1685.424	Yes . 	
A	1684.26	1684.48	Yeah . 	
B	1685.36	1687.36	um in the sense that 	
B	1689.15	1698.06	um did you feel like a team ? Or did you feel like uh autonomy ? 	
C	1695.04	1696.24	Yeah , I'd say , as a team . 	
D	1696.56	1712.38	Although we had our separate tasks , there was so much interaction , so much that we needed to um bounce off each other . And I've certainly felt heard , listened to in that in relevant areas we've been able to , you know , give and take and adjust our remit where necessary . 	
A	1697.03	1698.21	I think we had a nice time . 	
C	1698.48	1698.85	Yeah . 	
C	1701.17	1703.07	Find out from each other , yeah . 	
C	1711.3	1711.6	Yeah . 	
B	1711.58	1711.97	Mm-hmm . 	
A	1713.31	1725.57	Yeah , I think there was uh very constructive feedback by everybody . It's not like people trying to cut each other . There is more of uh true cohesive teamwork . We came to a very predic creative design , yeah . 	
C	1725.376	1725.888		
B	1725.582	1727.009		
A	1726.72	1727.616	Yeah , and uh 	
A	1728.92	1731.37	Yeah , I think . And Sarah , you coordinated the work very well . 	
B	1731.84	1734.46	Thank you . How did you find it ? 	
C	1734.64	1767.99	Yeah , no , I thought it it went really well and I yeah , I I feel that everyone was listened to and all the points that were raised seem to have been sorted out , although we didn't quite make the voice recognition in there , but that's that's good . I think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually if if if we'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out , I think maybe it would've come out a d little different , but yeah . 	
A	1752.213	1752.962		
B	1753.18	1753.63	Yeah . 	
A	1753.621	1754.264		
B	1766.96	1788.9	Yeah . I liked the fact that we could say an idea and it'd be suggested that that wasn't the best idea , but no one felt like shot down , you know , y it didn't matter it saying what you thought , because if it wasn't something that was that relevant , then it didn't matter , 'cause it was just another idea in the field . I like that . Um 	
C	1778.02	1778.37	Yeah . 	
A	1778.4	1778.8	Yeah . 	
C	1786.58	1786.94	Mm . 	
D	1787.34	1787.63	Yeah . 	
B	1790.08	1794.86	teamwork . Well you two created that wonderful specimen of a Play-Doh model . 	
C	1793.184	1793.728		
D	1794.816	1796.526		
C	1795.18	1796.01	Yeah , well . 	
A	1795.96	1799.2	I think that was the best part of the 	
B	1795.96	1806.0	Um uh I'm still not caught up . But that's nothing to do with the teamwork at all . Um 	
C	1797.552	1798.778		
C	1801.974	1803.384		
D	1803.61	1804.43		
C	1804.249	1804.756		
D	1806.77	1814.19	Maybe we should think of branching out into children's toys and fake mobile phones as a side line . And fake R_C_s . 	
B	1810.0	1810.65	Maybe . 	
A	1813.16	1813.39	'Kay . 	
B	1814.44	1821.33	No , that was quite fun . Um means , whiteboard , digital pens , etcetera , what does that mean ? Any ideas ? 	
C	1820.256	1823.33	Discuss which ones yeah . 	
A	1820.341	1821.33		
D	1820.59	1825.5	How do we evaluate the materials we had for communicating and sharing information ? 	
C	1825.79	1826.1	Yeah . 	
D	1826.9	1828.72	Could it've been better , was it adequate ? 	
C	1829.63	1835.03	Yeah , I think I think we probably woulda used the outer email system more , had we actually 	
B	1835.62	1836.679	Had time to kind of 	
D	1836.52	1837.14	Mm . 	
C	1837.06	1841.83	had had more time and if we'd been separated more . 	
B	1841.51	1849.84	Yeah , 'cause we could just sort of say , sorry what did you say about that or what do you think about that , rather than having to email it , yeah . But it was nice having it there . 	
C	1843.24	1843.52	Yeah . 	
C	1845.84	1846.17	Yeah . 	
C	1847.38	1847.86	Yeah . 	
D	1847.92	1848.29	Yeah . 	
B	1851.03	1853.5	Um like the whole picture of the thing . 	
A	1854.16	1862.63	Yeah , moving around the room . But I think it's good , like uh we spent times individually . 	
D	1856.75	1857.08	Yeah . 	
A	1894.74	1897.43	I never thought of a remote control with a flip top . 	
A	1898.652	1899.357		
B	1899.96	1902.966	Yeah , I think it's new ideas in general , rather than 	
D	1900.85	1909.22	It's really borrowing from other areas , it's , you know , bringing things from other areas in , it so it's I mean nothing is new , but it's applying it to a d in a different area . 	
C	1901.99	1902.3	Yeah . 	
B	1906.99	1907.39	Mm . 	
C	1909.27	1910.17	Vegetables . 	
A	1910.208	1912.04	That's mine . 	
B	1910.528	1912.152		
D	1910.8	1911.778		
C	1912.25	1912.7	Yeah . 	
D	1914.528	1915.04		
B	1915.75	1918.88	Yeah , no . Well they have to come from somewhere , don't they ? 	
A	1916.64	1917.39	Yeah , it's 	
D	1918.31	1919.44	Absolutely , yeah . 	
A	1920.04	1920.791	The thing is 	
B	1920.2	1942.16	And as sh as w sorry , you go . Um as was shown by your presentation with all of the other controls , remote controls , no one's thought about it particularly . I mean they're slightly different , so if someone's been shut in the room and said make ours a bit different from everyone else's , 'cause it's w something we should think about , but obviously no one's put any great deal of thought into it . 	
A	1921.75	1922.51	Yep , sorry , go on Sarah . 	
C	1930.56	1930.94	No . 	
D	1930.95	1931.27	Mm-hmm . 	
D	1937.5	1937.92	Mm-hmm . 	
C	1939.726	1962.77	Yeah , I do I don't think the the companies are really concerned . They're just like we've got a D_V_D_ player , does anyone remember the remote control ? Can't you get the one that we used for the last one ? Yeah , just jazz it up a bit . Uh d they don't really think about it , because normally , the remote control isn't the product which they're trying to ship . They're trying to ship the D_V_D_ player , the video player , the T_V_ . 	
D	1952.42	1952.62	Yeah . 	
B	1953.89	1954.23	Mm . 	
D	1954.5	1955.26	Yeah . 	
D	1960.07	1962.02	Yeah , the focus isn't on to that , yeah . 	
B	1961.76	1995.56	But then when it everything is really smart , and you've just got this big chunk of black thing sitting on your coffee table , it doesn't go , I mean if you could have something that's a proper funky thing , a funky item that's individual , individual to you , I mean they could even go into um you go in with an idea and they design it on Photoshop and then they just get it printed on the plastic , you would pray you would pay a lot extra , because it's individually being a plastic was being made for you . But people could have anything that they wanted . 	
C	1964.63	1964.92	Yeah . 	
C	1967.13	1967.44	Yeah . 	
C	1970.05	1970.65	No . 	
D	1972.064	1972.768		
C	1972.82	1973.2	Yeah . 	
C	1984.68	1985.01	Yeah . 	
C	1991.38	1991.9	Yeah . 	
C	1995.45	1995.9	Mm . 	
A	1996.81	2013.027	Surprising to me is like uh people give a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones , like a real want to see a new launch or something like that . And new f television products coming up , but nobody giving uh much idea to this . Like Sarah was telling , everything's 	
B	1997.12	1997.92	Because of the produ 	
B	2002.0	2002.3	Mm . 	
C	2005.7	2006.06	Yeah . 	
D	2011.08	2039.61	I think it's really good that this has been very market research based , because just going back to mobile phones , I mean this is the first change in remote control devices that I can really , you know , say is is obvious and visible . We see it in mobile phones a lot , and tha that's where we've borrowed a lot of our ide our ideas from . There are innovations in that that people don't really want . I see people wanting a model of the phone they were really happy with , and they can't get it anymore and it's innovation for innovation's sake , and I think it's wonderful our company's so R_ and D_ based . 	
A	2015.69	2015.97	Right . 	
B	2031.17	2031.83	Yes . 	
C	2031.37	2031.77	Yeah . 	
B	2034.61	2035.07	Yeah . 	
B	2039.73	2045.99	Well , it's innovation for money's sake . The the people have to keep buying . Yeah . 	
A	2040.11	2040.54	Mm-hmm . 	
D	2042.384	2048.92	Yeah . But forcing it onto people , yeah . It's things that , you know , they might want to buy the thing they really want . 	
B	2048.06	2056.43	And you can't get you've got your handset that works fine , but you can't get the battery anymore for that type of phone , because the phones have moved on , things like that . Yes . 	
D	2051.83	2053.21	Mm . Mm . 	
D	2054.57	2056.62	Or there isn't a cover to fit it or whatever , yeah . 	
B	2057.78	2059.584	It's madness . Um 	
D	2059.06	2059.832	See I think 	
B	2062.24	2063.616	In closing 	
A	2063.476	2064.868		
C	2063.883	2065.52		
B	2064.6	2077.52	There we go . Um our costs are below budget with recommendations that they the budget be increased , but I think I don't know , d what do you think ? Do you think that's takes into account um 	
B	2079.97	2080.71	overheads 	
B	2081.56	2089.83	like us being well paid kind of a thing ? And the heating for the building , do you think our budget includes everything , all the costs that are going out ? 	
A	2084.066	2085.603		
C	2084.144	2084.806		
C	2085.81	2086.12	Well . 	
D	2089.6	2092.97	I think it was just the produc uh just the production cost of the phone . 	
C	2091.18	2093.27	I think that was just the the physical . 	
B	2093.12	2108.811	So it looks well it looks like it's gonna be fifty percent profit , you've still got all of the overheads to come out of that . So maybe increasing it , you would also have to increase the price that it's sold at . But I think but you were saying that that's quite 	
C	2096.66	2096.97	Yeah . 	
D	2097.24	2097.71	Mm-hmm . 	
C	2099.96	2100.23	Yeah . 	
A	2105.59	2107.07	Maybe fifty percent more . 	
C	2105.88	2110.64	Yeah , I think yeah I don't from the market research . 	
D	2108.55	2122.45	But I think in the remit that we were given , it was very specific . I think we've done what we were required to do , and I think there'll have to be another project team or a new project for us to look at at those kind of things . I don't think that's something we have to look at and find a way of raising the cash for . 	
B	2112.64	2113.1	Hmm . 	
B	2120.6	2120.88	Yeah . 	
C	2120.85	2121.24	No . 	
C	2123.27	2124.448	Yeah , it was 	
D	2123.99	2131.52	I think we've done very well to get within budget and it still makes such an innovative item that I think people are really gonna want . 	
B	2126.04	2126.37	Mm . 	
B	2129.56	2130.04	Yeah . 	
A	2132.53	2132.96	Yeah . 	
B	2133.17	2139.84	It's a shame it won't ever get made . Maybe it will . Maybe someone'll r run down and patent it . 	
D	2134.77	2140.483	I know . Maybe it will . Maybe they are gonna steal our ideas and sell it . 	
C	2135.152	2136.065		
A	2136.65	2137.2	Who knows ? 	
C	2138.21	2143.76	I it's top secret . Um it's it is it's a conspiracy going on here . That's what it is . 	
A	2142.586	2143.616		
B	2142.71	2164.5	Um the project has been evaluated well and truly . Um and we've got the meeting survey and questionnaire . Oh , so we've got about fifty minutes to catch up with everything that I fell behind with , so I'll be delegating in my um role as Project Supervisor , so good luck . 	
D	2142.832	2144.128		
A	2146.44	2146.76	Yeah . 	
D	2146.93	2147.39	Mm-hmm . 	
A	2151.4	2152.34	There's a final questionnaire . 	
C	2158.32	2158.928		
C	2160.256	2163.76	In your yeah . 	
A	2167.51	2169.49	Celebration , you didn't talk about that . 	
B	2169.54	2172.03	I think the celebration is the twenty five pounds . 	
A	2172.24	2174.118		
C	2172.634	2173.788		
B	2172.88	2174.64	Either that or we'll be dancing on the desks . 	
D	2174.478	2175.084		
C	2175.168	2176.528		
B	2176.68	2176.91	Oh . 	
D	2176.91	2177.77	Questionnaire . 	
C	2182.56	2184.23	Okay . Is that it then ? 	
B	2184.79	2186.77	Um yeah , just the last , I think . 	
C	2191.23	2192.53	Awesome . 	
B	2191.812	2195.0	I think I've got minutes for two of the meeting and the 	
B	2196.2	2197.03	last thingy . 	
D	2197.92	2199.58	Questionnaire done . 	
D	2200.84	2204.92	Oh , I didn't have to rate you on how much you influenced the meeting this time . 	
C	2204.6	2208.81	Was that not the questionnaire for the how you felt you'd done in your 	
C	2209.99	2210.17	thing ? 	
D	2210.77	2214.31	Oh , right . But do we not sometimes evaluate in these meetings too ? Yeah . 	
C	2211.56	2219.2	I don't think . Yeah , the the s yeah . I think yeah , questionnaire seven was the one I did just before the meeting . 	
A	2220.03	2220.34	Yeah . 	
C	2221.15	2221.33	Mm . 	
B	2221.68	2222.25	I just got con
