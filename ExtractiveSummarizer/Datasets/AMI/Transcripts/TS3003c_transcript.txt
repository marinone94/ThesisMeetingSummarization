A	21.26	36.02	Okay . Uh good afternoon . This is our third meeting already . I hope you enjoyed your lunch . I did anyway . Um let's see . 	
D	24.09	24.64	Good afternoon . 	
A	39.62	60.95	Presentation three . Okay this is um the second phase uh we're going to discuss today . It's the conceptual design meeting . And a few points of interest in this meeting um are the conceptual specification of components . 	
A	61.25	75.8	Uh conceptual specification of design . And also trend-watching . Um these are hopefully the points you addressed in uh your pre uh presentations you're going to show me in a few minutes . 	
A	77.08	98.0	Um but first I'll show you the agenda . Uh first the opening . Then we have three presentations . Uh after that we have to come to a decision on remote control concepts . How we're going to make it . And then we're closing . We have about forty minutes . 	
A	99.11	107.47	Uh so I suggest let's get started . Uh did someone encounter any problems during the preparation ? 	
A	109.64	112.56	No ? Everything fine ? That's nice . 	
B	109.75	109.97	No . 	
D	110.409	111.151		
A	114.8	139.87	Then a little uh thing about the last meeting . Uh these are the points um we agreed on . The requirements and the target market . Uh requirements are uh teletext , docking station , audio signal , small screen , with some extras that uh button information . And we are going to use default materials . 	
A	141.37	157.55	Um does somebody have any comments on these requirements ? Maybe ? No ? These are just the the things we thought of , so maybe if you figured something else or thought of something else , just let me know . And maybe we can uh work it out . 	
A	158.44	163.34	And we're going to target uh sixty to to eighty year old customers . 	
A	165.11	174.02	So now everybody knows what we're do we're doing , um I suggest let's get started with the presentations . 	
A	175.32	180.12	So shall we keep the same uh line-up as uh last time ? 	
D	180.27	183.0	Sure . I'll start off then . 	
A	180.89	181.24	Okay . 	
A	182.67	184.768	Good luck . 	
D	192.77	193.34	Doh . 	
D	203.97	216.1	'Kay I'm uh gonna inform you about the trend-watching I've done over the past few days . Um we've done some market research . We distributed some more enquetes , questionnaires . 	
D	216.7	235.25	And um besides that um I deployed some trend-watchers to Milan and Paris to well get all of the newest trends . And I've consulted some additional trend-watch trend-watchers , after the original trend-watchers return , about what the 	
D	236.85	254.62	the best design would be . Um okay these are some overall findings . Um most important thing is the fancy design . Um the research indicated that that was by far the most important factor . 	
D	255.1	267.76	Um innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design . By innovativeness this means um functions which are not featured in other remote controls . 	
D	268.97	291.93	Um about half of , half as important as the innovativeness was the was easy to use . Um for our um group , we're focusing on the people of sixty to eighty y years old , this is um , these factors are slightly more equal . 	
D	295.07	310.93	'Kay these are some more group specific findings . Uh the older people prefer dark colours . Uh they like recognisable shapes , and familiar material . And our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much 	
D	312.0	327.64	the material for older people . Um this is , this image will give you a little bit of an impression about um the look-and-feel that um the remote should have . 	
D	331.07	339.33	Um this leads us to some personal preferences . Uh the remote control and the docking station should uh blend in in the 	
D	340.45	362.7	in the room . Um so this would mean no uh eye-catching designs . Just keep it simple and Well the docking station and small screen would be our main points of interest , because this would be the These would uh be the innovativeness in the remote control . 	
D	363.93	384.7	So this would be very important that we at least include these features . Um well the trend-watchers I consulted advised that it b should be , the remote control and the docking station should be telephone-shaped . So you could imagine that uh the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station . 	
D	385.5	401.7	This is not really This is pretty much a new shape to uh older people . So they would prefer uh a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station . So it would be kinda more telephone-shaped . 	
D	402.66	422.27	Um besides that we would advise um to bring two editions , one with a wood-like colour and maybe feel , and one with a grey-black colour . The wood-like for the more uh exclusive people . People with more money . Uh the grey-black colour for well 	
D	425.33	427.3	people with less means . 	
D	430.97	432.03	That would be all . 	
A	432.55	437.58	Okay . Thank you . Any questions about the the trends ? Mayb 	
D	436.35	437.11	Any questions ? 	
B	438.38	439.43	Mm no . 	
A	440.59	443.65	No ? Okay , we go on to the next one . 	
B	449.941	451.053		
A	462.981	463.587		
B	464.17	485.34	Um 'kay um yeah . uh some uh research uh a about um designing of an interface . Um the uh last meeting uh we had a about um uh using a f few buttons . So uh um uh that's w what I what I want to uh 	
B	486.81	509.317	uh to do in uh our design . So um finding an attractive uh way to control uh the remote control . Um the uh I found some uh something about uh speech uh recognition . So maybe uh we can uh use uh that . Um 	
B	509.39	522.63	Uh and uh using a little uh display . So um findings . Um yeah just um we have just to focus on the primary um functions . 	
B	522.8	539.31	So uh only uh buttons uh for uh sound , um for uh on-off , um uh shifting u up uh sa uh ca channel or uh down shifting down . Um uh let's see . Um yeah and 	
B	540.53	562.47	Uh we uh need some uh new a attractive functions uh uh which attract uh uh people for using it . So uh it's uh like a speak uh speech uh recognition and um a special button for selecting uh subtitles . Just uh what we uh mentioned uh last uh meeting . 	
B	563.4	571.76	Um and yeah overall um user-friendly . So uh using uh large large buttons . Um 	
B	574.59	593.15	It's uh possible to uh uh to make um quite cheap uh system for uh speech uh recognition . Um you can think about um uh when you lost your um remote control , you can uh call it and um it gives an um sig signal . So uh uh yeah . 	
B	593.56	609.728	And and uh for uh shifting up a sen uh c ch channel or uh for um uh putting out uh sound or something , you can uh just give a sign uh say um sound off or 	
B	610.35	617.906	A and uh yeah . Television uh put the sound off uh put the sound off uh . Um 	
B	619.8	631.87	Let's see . Uh yeah . I was thinking about the special uh button for uh subtitles , um just one button to keep it uh simple . Uh one push on the button uh you get uh uh small uh subtitles . 	
B	632.53	642.04	Um double push push um , if double click , um so uh you get uh big uh subtitles , for uh people uh 	
B	643.28	651.68	um uh which c f uh who can't uh read small uh subtitles . So uh Um 	
B	653.0	666.08	Yeah and w we have to keep uh in general buttons uh so um we've got um the buttons we have to use . The on-off , sound on-off , sound higher or lower , um the numbers , uh zero to uh uh nine . 	
B	667.22	685.47	Um the general buttons m more general b one button for shifting up and shifting down uh channel . Um also we want to uh use a little d display uh for um for displaying the uh the functions of the buttons . 	
B	686.09	702.336	And um we can uh build in a function f which uh shows the channel or some uh which the t television is on . So um made a little uh picture of uh it . Um 	
B	703.62	704.29	See . 	
B	709.75	734.16	Um yeah . Just um we can put uh the on-off button uh over in this uh corner , um almost uh e all uh remote controls uh are using a on-off button on that place . Um so uh people uh will uh recognise uh um the button . So um 	
C	726.496	728.976		
B	735.38	746.15	D display uh of it , it's uh just a small display . Uh um you can put it uh on top . Um it's uh most uh 	
B	747.88	765.856	uh place where people uh , most of looks at . So uh um and a special uh button for shifting up uh and uh shifting down uh channel , um it's uh on place where um the thumb of of the 	
B	767.21	774.04	So you you can uh easily uh shift up or shift down . Um it's uh quite uh 	
B	775.6	783.163	handy place . So um and uh all the f functions for subtitle uh one button , uh for sound uh 	
B	784.71	793.041	Uh and uh for our design , um uh we have to discuss about it uh I think uh so uh the form of it so 	
A	794.24	794.55	Okay . 	
B	794.71	795.73	And that's it . 	
A	796.33	798.105	Uh thank you . 	
C	807.71	808.33	Okay . 	
C	814.38	836.01	About the components design . Um for the energy source we can use a basic battery or , a as an optional thing , a kinetic energy , like in a watch , which you just shake and it produces energy . But if we choose for that option , the docking station would c become obsolete . So I don't think it's really an option . 	
C	836.87	853.47	Uh for the casing , uh the uh manufacturing department can deliver uh a flat casing , single or double curved casing . It's really up the the design that we're gonna use . It's uh doesn't uh imply any technical restrictions . 	
C	854.24	861.53	Uh as a case supplement , we could um , I thought of that l later , uh a rubber uh belt , like a anti-slip . 	
C	863.41	873.26	Uh for the b buttons , we can use plastic or rubber . And the chip-set , um it says simple here , but it should be advanced , because we're using an L_C_D_ uh screen . 	
C	874.18	889.13	And as uh the trend-watcher presentation showed , um people like wood , but it raises the price and it doesn't really fit the image , unless we would start two product lines . Form should follow function overall . 	
C	889.7	915.76	Um well the kinetic energy source is rather fancy . But depends on what we want . I think we should disc discuss that . Um for the case , uh the supplement and the buttons , it really depends on the designer . And the chip-set uh really should be advanced because otherwise uh it would really be a simple uh remote control . And that's it . 	
A	916.21	917.84	Okay . Thank you . 	
A	920.09	924.32	So that brings us to the discussion about our concepts . 	
A	926.95	927.81	Mm . 	
D	933.492	934.267		
A	934.63	934.94	'Kay . 	
A	945.06	948.25	So these are the points we have to discuss . 	
A	949.6	953.18	Um first 	
A	955.54	960.21	I think we can talk about the energy source , since that's um 	
A	961.65	970.11	has a pretty big influence on production price , uh and image . Uh so 	
B	965.798	966.438		
A	971.25	979.27	uh f I think first of all we have to see uh it is possible to introduce kinetic energy in our budget , I think . 	
C	977.98	997.67	Yes w there there are four options . We could use the basic normal battery . Uh a hand dynamo . But I don't think that's really an option . You don't wanna swing before you can watch television . Uh solar cells . But not every room is very light so it's not a very good option . Or the kinetic energy . 	
A	982.32	982.66	Yeah . 	
A	984.832	987.896	Okay . 	
B	986.285	989.517		
D	986.711	987.864		
A	988.428	989.838		
A	990.66	991.03	Yeah . 	
B	994.4	994.85	Mm . 	
A	995.59	996.16	No . 	
A	999.41	1001.06	Yeah . Okay . 	
D	1000.75	1004.242	And how exactly does the kinetic energy work ? You just 	
C	1003.6	1007.88	Well y you basically shake your remote , and then it powers up . Yeah . 	
D	1005.16	1007.47	You use it and it works . 	
B	1006.614	1007.341		
A	1008.48	1008.84	Yeah . 	
D	1009.02	1017.06	Okay . Well personally I don't think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it . 	
B	1009.07	1009.4	Nah . 	
B	1015.761	1017.815		
C	1016.48	1018.16	Yeah . That's true . 	
D	1019.23	1032.67	And besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete . And I think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we can um 	
C	1023.66	1023.76	Oh . 	
D	1033.72	1035.6	get great popularity for our product . 	
A	1037.68	1038.13	Yeah . 	
B	1038.0	1038.51	But 	
D	1038.44	1040.07	Um wel 	
B	1039.73	1043.74	what's the function ? Yeah f for loading up uh the batteries . 	
D	1044.23	1051.96	Yeah you could load up the batteries , you could um insert the find the lost remote control function in there . 	
B	1045.02	1045.41	B b 	
B	1052.8	1073.328	Okay but uh it won't use uh much e energy uh I I believe . Uh it's uh just a small display so I believe uh it will run on one battery for um six months or f or or more . So I believe one battery uh is just enough . Uh so 	
A	1068.73	1069.217	Uh 	
A	1073.99	1091.57	Uh well I think uh elderly people just like to have everything in place . And I don't think they they like uh remotes just laying everywhere in their rooms . So maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place . 	
D	1074.9	1077.292	That's true . 	
B	1087.18	1087.63	Okay . 	
B	1090.92	1092.03	Yeah . That's true . Yeah . 	
A	1092.41	1114.41	And also what you said . Um you can introduce voice recognition by uh finding back your remote . But I think it's um more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station . So you have a but button on your docking station which you can push , and then it starts beeping . 	
B	1100.48	1100.7	Mm-hmm . 	
B	1101.7	1102.13	Yeah . 	
B	1114.8	1115.65	Okay . 	
A	1116.26	1122.14	And then we can we can still use the voice recognition , but maybe then for only the the channels . 	
B	1117.93	1118.59	Yeah . 	
B	1122.65	1123.01	Uh . 	
A	1123.23	1123.96	That's safe . 	
D	1123.34	1129.54	I'm wondering um what will the voice recognition mean for the production price ? 	
A	1130.24	1131.98	Yeah . That's a good point . 	
C	1131.38	1136.32	Mm I don't have any information on pricing . So I'll have to ask the manufacturing department . 	
B	1136.65	1136.96	Mm . 	
D	1137.34	1145.57	'Cause in our earlier um market research , if you'd allow me to go to the flat board , SMARTboard . 	
A	1142.65	1144.77	Yeah , sure . Go ahead . 	
D	1150.59	1152.36	Um so it was open here . 	
D	1153.62	1155.94	Um we also um 	
D	1159.13	1172.29	asked if w they would , if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . Well you can see here , our target group would not do that . So if that would increase the price for which we're selling our remote control 	
A	1167.87	1168.27	No . 	
B	1173.23	1173.37	Mm . 	
D	1173.92	1181.75	I would greatly advise not to do it . I think that would be better to uh insert in our other product , that is meant for the 	
A	1176.47	1176.9	Yeah . 	
B	1176.813	1177.586		
A	1183.13	1183.3	Yeah . 	
D	1183.21	1183.91	younger people . 	
C	1185.32	1188.11	But that would also go for the L_C_D_ screen then I guess . 	
B	1185.63	1186.21	'Kay . 	
C	1189.47	1191.653	It's a bit higher percentage , but 	
D	1193.12	1209.7	Um well this is Yeah but this is here the question was , would you prefer it . So that doesn't really mean they wouldn't pay extra for it . And on top of that the L_C_D_ screen would um help in making the remote control easier to use . 	
B	1210.7	1210.91	Yeah . 	
A	1211.95	1212.66	Yeah . 	
D	1212.14	1217.73	And I think a voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use . 	
C	1212.3	1212.67	Okay . 	
A	1216.95	1219.62	Easier to use ? No , I think that's a good point . 	
B	1220.11	1230.74	But uh is uh our uh research um about um bi large uh L_C_D_ sh uh display , or uh just a small one uh we want to uh use ? 	
D	1230.63	1237.44	Um well this was for like an L_C_D_ screen like you would have on a on the the most advanced mobile phones . 	
B	1237.71	1238.2	Okay . 	
D	1238.48	1239.71	So pretty large . 	
B	1240.02	1240.26	Yeah . 	
A	1240.36	1240.69	Yeah . 	
A	1243.48	1257.57	I personally think the L_C_D_ screen we wanna use , with the extra information , I think nobody has anything against it . Because it's just uh some extra information , and it's easy to ignore as well . So if you don't wanna use it you just don't use it . 	
B	1250.6	1250.82	No . 	
B	1254.68	1254.92	Yeah . 	
A	1258.42	1279.46	And um yeah I think the um Maybe we have to uh discard the voice recognition . Because it will increase cost uh signifi uh significantly . And I don't think the I don't think it will be a lot easier to use , as well . 	
B	1280.08	1280.51	Yeah . 	
A	1281.22	1292.272	So that brings us back to the energy . If we don't have the voice recognition , it will it won't use a lot of energy to use . Um 	
B	1289.74	1290.03	Mm-hmm . 	
A	1293.49	1304.66	So in that case we could use kinetic uh energy , but I think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good . And much cheaper as well . 	
B	1304.78	1305.0	Yeah . 	
A	1305.86	1306.506	So 	
C	1305.9	1307.14	And that's the best choice . 	
A	1307.7	1314.84	Okay let me just choose for the battery . That brings us to the chip . 	
C	1315.52	1321.0	Well there isn't any choice there because we're using the the the the display . So it's gotta be advanced . 	
A	1317.5	1318.47	Just the advanced . 	
A	1321.27	1324.65	Okay , advanced chip . 	
D	1321.92	1322.25	'Kay . 	
A	1330.09	1347.32	And then we get to the point of the case . Um which brings us a little bit back to marketing as well . Uh if we wanna choose for wood or the black and grey . Or both ? 	
A	1349.08	1372.752	Um as we saw there is not Yeah wood is a lot more expensive to produce . Um but I think it will attract elderly people who wanna have something exclusive , which they can show off to their grandkids . Look I've got a new remote control , and uh 	
D	1355.35	1355.72	Mm-hmm . 	
D	1368.87	1369.36	Mm-hmm . 	
C	1370.546	1371.253		
D	1371.39	1381.36	Well And I think most important factor there is the wooden colour . So it wouldn't actually have to be wood , if it's just 	
B	1371.88	1373.59	Uh I dunno . 	
A	1380.5	1380.85	Yeah . 	
A	1383.51	1383.99	That's right . 	
D	1384.85	1385.58	wood-coloured . 	
B	1385.06	1385.49	Mm . 	
A	1386.17	1389.04	But with colour was a lot more expensive ? Or ? 	
C	1389.25	1393.05	Mm I dunno . I'll have to uh research . 	
A	1389.87	1390.38	You don't know ? 	
A	1392.12	1400.64	I think so because Yeah . It's a lot more difficult to to handle and to to get in the right shape . 	
D	1394.59	1395.6	Probably . 	
B	1395.11	1395.44	Mm . 	
B	1400.79	1418.07	Uh is it possible uh to make um changeable uh case . So um uh you 'cause uh Yeah with uh mobile phones uh uh so uh like the Nokia mobile phones , uh when you can change the case of it . So 	
A	1413.87	1414.21	Yeah . 	
A	1417.83	1419.39	Change the cases . Yeah . 	
B	1419.3	1433.82	maybe it's possible uh possibility . So um um you have just to make one um standard um remote control , and um yeah you can sell uh few uh Yeah . 	
A	1432.61	1447.807	You can sell the cases . Yeah . I think that's a very good option . Because um then you can advertise as well with the Give your grandfather a new case for his remote control , or whatever . 	
B	1444.43	1444.74	Yeah . 	
C	1445.861	1446.737		
D	1445.897	1446.908		
A	1448.13	1461.45	Because that's a it's something extra , it's something other remotes don't have , which we can get a great advantage point . So and then you can make them with colour . Black and grey , other colours as well . 	
B	1452.67	1452.96	Yeah . 	
D	1453.95	1455.74	Yeah that is true . 	
B	1460.62	1461.08	Yeah . 	
D	1461.8	1466.7	Yeah . We would have to look carefully into the design though . 	
A	1466.05	1466.74	Costs . 	
D	1468.87	1475.17	'Cause we would have to make one w uh control which would fit in with a wooden cover and a 	
D	1476.46	1481.53	plastic cover . The more original one , or the more standard one . 	
A	1477.96	1478.2	Yeah . 	
A	1482.94	1487.7	Yeah . So you suggest we should design two different telephones 	
D	1483.0	1483.558	So that would 	
A	1488.93	1498.3	on which you can apply , yeah remote controls , on which you can apply different case covers , for example . 	
D	1489.01	1491.841	Well I wouldn't design a telephone but 	
C	1490.448	1491.776		
B	1492.01	1493.115		
D	1496.55	1500.94	Well no I think w we should just , we should then just design one um 	
A	1502.18	1502.59	Remote . 	
D	1502.37	1508.67	one remote , but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one . 	
A	1507.79	1508.12	Yeah . 	
A	1509.86	1510.36	Okay . 	
D	1510.65	1513.05	So , but that shouldn't be too much of a problem . 	
A	1514.24	1517.67	So everybody's okay with the changing covers ? 	
C	1518.39	1518.62	Yes . 	
A	1518.53	1520.59	I think that's a good uh good option . 	
B	1518.57	1518.94	Yeah . 	
A	1523.88	1525.55	Changing case covers . 	
D	1524.94	1533.12	Um I heard our Industrial Designer talk about uh flat , single and double curved . Could you explain that a little more ? 	
C	1530.81	1531.23	Yes . 	
A	1531.23	1531.58	Yeah . 	
C	1533.41	1546.99	Well the the general like most older remotes are flat , just straight . And uh our d manufacturing department can also deliver single curved or double curved ca curved cases . 	
D	1540.01	1540.34	Mm-hmm . 	
D	1547.27	1549.54	And what would single curved and double curved mean ? 	
C	1550.07	1562.36	Um it would just only affect the form , for as far as I know . So it's j really just up to the design department what we're gonna use . It doesn't really matter for the price or the functionality . 	
D	1559.92	1560.33	Okay . 	
D	1562.64	1565.39	So we can pretty much just do whatever we want . 	
C	1564.12	1565.37	Pick one you like , yes . 	
A	1566.62	1567.61	Mm . Okay . 	
D	1566.64	1566.88	'Kay . 	
D	1567.88	1568.23	That's good . 	
A	1569.32	1573.188	Uh but the form has to be um It has to 	
A	1574.41	1579.12	It's has to be possible to stand up ? Or just only to lie down ? 	
D	1578.46	1579.67	No just to lie down . 	
B	1579.66	1580.71	okay . 	
A	1580.5	1584.16	And the the cover of the the docking station is also 	
D	1581.25	1582.29	We'll go for that . 	
A	1585.25	1587.92	on top of the television then ? Or not ? 	
D	1587.87	1588.89	Well or besides it . 	
A	1589.91	1600.48	And you can just yeah then click it in . That's okay . Um so the interface . What type of interface do we want to use ? 	
A	1601.88	1607.09	Um maybe you can make a little drawing of it on the 	
D	1602.624	1603.424		
D	1607.83	1608.32	Mm-hmm . 	
A	1609.01	1613.81	on the the board . Does somebody have ideas for a form or 	
B	1610.9	1611.31	Mm . 	
B	1615.37	1622.133	Uh we can just use the regular form of it , but it's um not quite uh fancy . So um 	
B	1623.27	1623.65	Yeah . 	
D	1624.57	1649.0	Um you uh said you wanted to put the um changing channels button on the right side , so you could , so your thumb would be easily Well uh I think that was a very good point 'cause I pointed out earlier that a lot of remotes cause R_S_I_ . So that would be great for that . Um I thought maybe we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and the right side . 	
B	1631.83	1633.14	Yeah . Yeah . 	
B	1641.73	1642.424		
B	1650.67	1653.24	For uh Uh for Yeah yeah . 	
D	1650.95	1653.55	For left-handed users also . 	
A	1653.43	1653.76	Yep . 	
B	1654.26	1654.49	Mm . 	
B	1655.76	1656.71	Yeah we um 	
B	1658.29	1679.29	Is it possible to um program it s so uh you got on the left side uh or on the right side uh buttons for for shifting u up and shifting up ? And on the uh other uh uh o other side uh buttons for uh shifting , uh for for the sound ? Or Or isn't it ? 	
D	1676.54	1679.85	For the volume . Um well that could 	
A	1679.16	1679.89	Mm . 	
D	1680.756	1687.21	Yeah we could do that but I'm not sure if that would be very good for the easy , ease of use . 	
A	1686.81	1692.529	Usabili Yeah ease of use will be a lot more difficult , and then it's 	
B	1687.84	1688.51	Yeah okay . 	
B	1692.63	1692.96	Uh . 	
A	1693.903	1694.88		
D	1693.96	1705.27	But if we would make um a changing channels and changing volume button on both sides , that would certainly yield great options for the design of the remote . 	
B	1706.79	1707.35	Mm . 	
D	1707.13	1709.4	'Cause it could be made all symmetrical and stuff . 	
B	1710.79	1711.669	Yeah but 	
A	1711.51	1714.95	But you have extra buttons . So people can get confused . 	
B	1712.174	1712.745		
B	1713.34	1713.69	Yeah . 	
B	1714.89	1715.29	Yeah . 	
D	1715.52	1716.17	That is true . 	
B	1716.46	1716.7	Yeah . 	
A	1717.73	1720.86	Especially if they have the same writings on it . 	
B	1722.36	1728.255	See um yeah . Or we have to make a left uh For lefties and 	
A	1726.41	1732.34	Can't we make uh Can't we make a remote which you can flip over and use 	
A	1733.4	1734.17	on the same 	
B	1735.09	1735.931	Um 	
A	1735.72	1737.89	functions as the normal one ? 	
B	1736.597	1737.331		
B	1738.54	1739.803	You mean um 	
A	1740.29	1741.944	Then you have to 	
B	1740.74	1741.655	Yeah if 	
A	1742.91	1743.98	Let's see if I ca 	
A	1746.21	1747.48	A blank one . 	
A	1750.68	1752.92	And then you get 	
A	1772.7	1774.82	Here's a little L_C_D_ screen . 	
A	1777.72	1781.07	Uh now I have to think . 	
A	1787.952	1788.659		
A	1804.34	1805.53	It's a plus and a min . 	
A	1808.61	1815.2	No it's not very handy I think . Because the plus and the min will be opposite and all kinds of 	
B	1810.3	1810.88	Mm no . 	
B	1813.07	1813.45	Yeah . 	
D	1813.2	1813.51	Yeah . 	
D	1815.328	1816.272		
A	1816.98	1818.13	No that's not gonna work . 	
A	1819.82	1832.62	I guess . Maybe we should Yeah . But is it a problem that left-handed persons use a different hand ? I think the functions are 	
B	1821.31	1822.369	Um 	
A	1833.89	1839.815	that basic that nobody should have any problems with uh choosing a channel or 	
D	1837.99	1840.02	Yeah . That is true . 	
B	1839.73	1840.2	Yeah . 	
B	1841.79	1846.873	It's just uh u using uh your thumb . So um it's 	
A	1844.6	1849.61	Y yeah . Yeah . I think we could just uh leave it a normal shape . 	
B	1849.58	1849.92	Yeah . 	
C	1849.99	1850.35	Yeah . 	
A	1851.92	1853.65	Uh but maybe we have to 	
A	1855.66	1859.88	make it a l a bit more fancy . In one or ano another way . 	
B	1860.06	1861.116	Yeah . Um 	
C	1861.94	1867.85	I think we should start by by choosing a case . Because that's the basis you're building on . 	
B	1866.91	1868.32	Yeah yeah . 	
A	1868.74	1869.14	Yeah . 	
D	1869.23	1869.37	Yeah . 	
A	1871.44	1874.041	Um yeah just 	
C	1871.76	1874.45	So I could draw them out . 	
C	1880.24	1881.51	Let's look at the flat case . 	
C	1882.71	1883.3	Oh . 	
C	1889.73	1899.93	It's from the side so it's rather normal . The the single curved so I'm not really sure what they're gonna look like , but I think it's something like this . 	
B	1891.38	1892.05	Mm-hmm . 	
D	1891.82	1892.1	Mm-hmm . 	
A	1892.55	1892.91	Yeah . 	
C	1907.36	1916.32	So this type should be better for you or better Should prevent repetitive strain injury a bit . 	
A	1911.99	1912.48	Easier ? 	
C	1918.55	1922.74	And the double curved s looks something like this I guess . 	
B	1933.15	1933.41	Mm . 	
C	1933.16	1936.0	So th those are the three options we have . 	
A	1936.23	1957.59	'Kay . I suggest um the single curved , because maybe the curve is pretty good to put the the screen in . Uh so that elderly people can uh use the remote control and at the same time look easily at the screen , because it's a bit , it has a bit of a angle . 	
D	1936.99	1937.19	Mm . 	
B	1942.769	1943.447		
B	1955.79	1956.631	So um 	
B	1958.76	1960.402	Do you say this um 	
B	1963.28	1964.308	S uh 	
B	1967.67	1972.66	Uh you got like uh sort of a I believe There ? 	
D	1972.52	1972.77	Mm-hmm . 	
B	1974.0	1979.8	So um you want to put a display over here ? Or not ? Yeah . 	
A	1979.09	1980.56	Yeah . I think so . Yeah . 	
B	1981.41	1982.392	Um 	
B	1983.62	2001.098	Yeah . Uh we can make it um Mm ? That's the top . So uh this top . This down . Um maybe it's possible to uh make this side like um Let's see . Um 	
A	1984.97	1985.866	But now it's 	
A	1986.88	1991.53	Do you have it upside down or Do you have it this that's top ? 	
A	1992.49	1992.9	Okay . 	
B	2001.96	2004.28	Colour uh okay . 	
B	2010.75	2014.25	Uh to make this side um like mm 	
B	2016.7	2023.048	the right colour . Um bit like so uh um in the form of your hand . So um 	
A	2017.8	2019.113		
B	2024.46	2025.456	Uh it's an 	
A	2025.82	2026.22	Yeah . 	
B	2026.95	2035.36	So so the remote control have to um lay in your hand . So uh it's possib um yeah for s so and 	
A	2034.61	2036.18	So get your mouse . Yeah . 	
B	2037.14	2041.51	And to put uh the the buttons for um 	
B	2042.86	2046.202	changing uh the channel uh over here uh 	
A	2046.92	2053.86	Yeah . That's a good one . But I think it's better to put the screen uh on top . 	
B	2049.46	2049.69	Yeah . 	
C	2049.54	2049.69	Yeah . 	
B	2054.601	2056.45	Uh rem 	
A	2055.63	2067.61	So just flip it a hundred and eighty degrees around then you get here . If you can have this one , you turn it like this . And then flip it upside down . 	
B	2059.11	2061.503	Yeah but this place um 	
B	2068.38	2070.608	Uh it's Yeah I dunno um 	
A	2070.43	2074.9	Because uh maybe your hand is in the way , if you have the display here . 	
B	2074.03	2074.36	Yeah . 	
D	2074.3	2074.62	Mm-hmm . 	
C	2076.52	2081.85	It's more logical to have it on top as well because , like on your mobile phone , it's always above . 	
B	2076.922	2077.719		
A	2078.6	2079.0	I think i 	
B	2079.05	2080.615	Yeah so 	
D	2081.37	2081.79	Yeah . 	
A	2081.51	2081.88	On top . 	
B	2086.19	2086.691	So 	
A	2086.93	2088.0	Yeah . 	
B	2087.612	2089.363		
C	2088.03	2090.3	Oh maybe you should just s start on a blank page . 	
A	2089.01	2092.883	. So then we get 	
D	2090.56	2091.19	Yeah . 	
A	2106.36	2108.38	Here's That's the curve . 	
B	2117.25	2118.829	Five minutes . 	
A	2122.81	2134.21	Here the display , and then buttons . Yeah and then we can have a little bit off here and here maybe . Just that's for left hand and right hand users . 	
B	2134.14	2134.89	Yeah . 	
D	2134.49	2134.8	Mm-hmm . 	
A	2136.08	2139.58	And then h the rest of the buttons over here . 	
B	2138.92	2144.63	Yeah . But um the on-off button , um still on the top uh Yeah . 	
A	2143.6	2144.99	Yeah still here jus 	
B	2145.84	2146.11	Yeah . 	
A	2146.53	2146.998	That's 	
D	2146.73	2149.2	And I'd prefer the corners to be round . 	
A	2149.45	2149.85	Yeah . 	
B	2149.9	2151.01	Yeah . 'Kay . 	
D	2151.01	2151.91	Think that would be better . 	
A	2151.21	2153.45	Should be more bit more friendly , yeah . 	
D	2154.35	2155.16	Friendly on the eye . 	
A	2155.72	2156.25	'Kay . 	
A	2157.59	2160.31	Supplements . That's okay . 	
A	2161.88	2164.979	Where's my mouse ? Then 	
A	2169.54	2188.2	We've got a general idea of the concepts and the materials we're going to use . So now for the next meeting uh we'll have to look at the look-and-feel design . It's important that the corporate design image uh is going to be in the remote . So check out the corporate website maybe . 	
A	2188.91	2207.71	The user interface design , it's the same story . And product evaluation . So the Industrial Designer and User Interface Designer are going to work together on this one . But you're going to get your instructions I think sended by the coach . 	
A	2208.54	2216.43	So just um I will put these um minutes on the in the folder . 	
C	2217.59	2217.83	Okay . 	
A	2218.6	2243.61	And then we're going to uh try to finish our project , and uh make a good design for all the grandfathers and grandmothers , I think . Which are Uh let's see . I'm not sure if you're going to start right away to work together or I think you're going to fill in the questionnaires first . And then you'll get a message . 	
D	2228.175	2230.208		
B	2228.295	2230.203		
C	2228.384	2229.969		
B	2241.49	2241.81	Yeah . 	
D	2242.05	2242.54	Yeah . 	
B	2243.54	2243.78	Yeah . 	
A	2244.81	2252.4	So that's uh basically it . Maybe this one ? Then we can save this one in the 	
A	2255.93	2256.85	folders group . 	
A	2261.73	2272.35	Uh yes , it's here . SMARTboard , there it it . So if you wanna have a look at it , it's over there in the projects folder . 	
D	2263.6	2263.82	Yeah . 	
B	2272.21	2272.38	Yeah . 	
A	2274.52	2277.64	And then I guess we'll start in thirty minutes again . 	
A	2279.26	2280.11	Thank you . 	
D	2279.46	2279.88	Very good . 	
C	2279.99	2280.28	Okay . 	
B	2280.01	2280.36	Okay .
