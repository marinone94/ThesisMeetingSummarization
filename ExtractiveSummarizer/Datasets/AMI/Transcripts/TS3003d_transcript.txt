A	11.79	12.476	So 	
A	20.7	22.656	Hello . 	
D	22.96	28.91	Good afternoon . Sorry I'm a little late . Got stuck in the traffic . 	
A	26.98	27.56	No problem . 	
C	28.944	30.048		
B	28.963	31.245		
A	29.17	44.5	Okay . That's possible on uh this time of day . Starts at three o'clock . Uh Uh , let me see . Our fourth and last meeting . 	
D	37.42	37.78	Yeah . 	
A	47.74	48.7	There he is . 	
A	51.99	52.65	Yes . 	
A	55.7	80.779	Okay this our last meeting . In this meeting we will discuss our final design . And we will do some evaluation about the , not only the product , but also the project . And then we're going to close the project today as well . So after this you will be uh free to go and uh spend all your money . 	
B	78.268	79.682		
D	78.282	78.841		
C	78.4	79.209		
D	80.181	80.893		
A	80.95	100.53	And this uh design , detailed design meeting uh we will discuss uh the look-and-feel of the design , the usability interface design , and we will do the product evaluation . Um , in order to do that we have this agenda . 	
A	101.36	128.98	We'll have the prototype presentation first . Then we will set up some evaluation cri um criteria . Then we will look at the finance . Uh we will have to see if everything we wanna do is also possible within our budget . Because everything costs money , and the more functions you wanna have the more money it will cost . So we have to see if it fits within the twelve and a half Euro per remote . 	
A	129.42	144.58	But we will see that later . Then we will do the project uh evaluation , and the closing after that . We've got forty minutes . So we will be finished at half past three . But first um 	
C	133.456	135.584		
A	145.8	155.36	we will do the this is prototype presentation . So , if some yeah if somebody wants step forward . 	
C	153.33	153.97	Okay . 	
C	157.91	171.43	Well this is what me and Richard came up with . The default spot for the on-off button . The mute button just below that . Then there's the volume and channel selectors . 	
C	172.79	184.59	Simple plus-minus button . Uh we thought of a help button . If you hold it and you press another button , uh the help goes to the L_C_D_ screen . 	
C	185.33	195.47	Then there's the zero to one to zero buttons . A button for teletext . A button for the subtitles . And the company logo . 	
C	196.65	205.09	So it's rather simple prototype . And uh we'll have to see from testing uh how the users take it . 	
A	206.27	206.74	Okay . 	
D	207.34	213.37	Um , is this the moment where we ask or can ask questions about the functionality ? 	
B	210.86	211.385	So 	
C	213.75	216.03	Sure uh just pop in at any time . 	
B	213.99	214.56	Yeah . Yeah . 	
D	216.29	225.26	Um , when you're in teletext there usually are buttons where you just you just press it and you g go to the next teletext page . 	
B	226.94	235.2	Uh , that's just uh the normal uh as th as the normal uh remote controls uh So um 	
B	236.26	252.51	You put it uh you um came in uh page uh one hundred . Now you can use the normal uh one to zero buttons . And you But you can also uh use the um button th for uh changing the the channel . 	
D	240.92	241.32	Mm-hmm . 	
B	252.6	261.68	S so uh the shifting uh button . Uh for uh yeah shif shifting up in uh on t on t uh teletext , and shifting uh down . So 	
D	255.36	255.67	Okay . 	
D	262.33	265.369	Okay . Um 	
D	267.26	267.54	Yeah . 	
A	269.19	289.15	Okay . Uh but um I thought in a few meetings earlier we uh uh tried to keep it uh simple . Uh just a few buttons and large buttons . But uh I think these are altogether quite a quite a few buttons . 	
B	280.2	280.81	Oh yeah ? 	
A	291.07	295.59	So I'm wondering if we if we neely really need all of those buttons . 	
B	292.48	293.027		
C	297.38	298.57	I think if you look at 	
B	297.799	298.247		
C	300.0	313.05	most controls , they've got more buttons than this . And well the on-off button , it's it's a necessity . You can't drop that one . The volume and channel buttons , you need you obviously need those those . 	
A	302.83	303.38	That's right . 	
B	303.27	303.53	Yeah . 	
B	306.53	306.69	Yeah . 	
A	306.6	306.96	Yeah . 	
A	313.43	313.92	Yeah . 	
C	314.35	331.98	The mute button could be replaced uh by pressing the volume-down button twice . So we could cancel that one . I think the help button really is necessary because there's no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does . 	
B	326.65	327.23	Yeah yeah . 	
A	334.71	335.5	Mm . 	
B	334.76	353.36	Uh , or you can build in uh when you press uh one button uh uh Yeah . But m Yeah . We disc discuss that already . But uh we think uh old people uh don't know that uh option . So uh they just put in uh put press uh the button and uh 	
A	338.73	341.435	Long time . Yeah . If you put 	
A	354.72	356.22	Yeah . Okay . 	
C	356.6	357.96	Well , you can't 	
C	359.3	361.07	leave out the number buttons I guess . 	
B	361.06	361.424	And uh 	
A	361.37	366.08	Yeah . Uh teletext and subtitles are yeah necessary . Okay . 	
C	362.63	363.13	And 	
C	363.13	364.32		
C	364.35	367.75	Yeah . So it's rather basic already . 	
B	364.71	364.98	Oh . 	
D	365.09	365.37	Yeah . 	
D	368.18	375.8	Yeah . Think so . That's what I pointed out earlier . If you just make a control for just the T_V_ there's just not much to gain here . 	
B	375.66	375.85	Yeah . 	
A	376.01	376.41	Yep . 	
A	378.02	383.0	Okay . So we had somebody about th interfa Something about the design of the buttons there ? 	
C	383.38	399.22	Yeah , they're It's rather hard to draw on the white-board . But they're supposed to be equal sized , round , with a with a little logo on it for the for the volume , the the triangle and stuff . Just for recognition . 	
B	384.52	386.509	Yeah . Yeah , it 	
A	384.53	386.6	Just n normal plain buttons . 	
B	396.21	398.708	Yeah yeah . Just to recognise it , so uh 	
A	396.54	398.43	Yeah . 'Kay . 	
B	399.39	402.528	Uh yeah and now we don't need uh LEDs or um 	
A	402.83	403.3	No . 	
B	403.56	413.536	Y uh s some uh remote controls uh do it also , but um uh because we use the little display we don't uh have to use it . Uh so 	
A	407.12	407.55	No . 	
A	412.94	414.5	Yeah . Okay . 	
C	414.53	423.26	So and for the materials we've just chosen for rubber buttons . With a a different colour than the case . So they jump out . 	
B	417.84	418.16	Nay . 	
A	418.75	418.95	Yep . 	
A	425.16	443.13	Okay . That's nice . Then because we only have thirty minutes left , I will move on to the finance part , which is pretty exciting , to see if it's all possible what we wanna do . And I can tell you 	
C	425.3	426.72	And uh that's about it . 	
D	444.288	445.104		
A	445.14	451.84	that we're going to have a pretty hard time producing this for twelve and a half Euros . 	
B	453.54	453.85	Mm . 	
A	454.2	465.71	If we see I don't know if I've filled in correctly , so just correct me if you see uh something wrong . I counted two batteries . But maybe we can also use one . I don't know if it's possible . 	
D	465.13	466.24	Since it rechargeable . 	
A	466.88	468.29	It's rechargeable . That's right . 	
B	467.88	469.898	Yeah we can u just uh 	
A	471.59	479.64	Okay . That's two Euros off . We need the advanced chip . So there's not much to uh 	
B	474.77	475.593	'Kay . 	
C	478.04	478.45	Yep . 	
A	481.84	494.16	to save there . Here we have the single curves . Uh we can see that the difference between uncurved and the single curved is one Euro . Um , 	
B	492.78	493.35	Mm . 	
A	495.67	507.71	I don't know , but I think the single curved is good for design , and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control . I think we have to keep that . 	
B	500.35	500.83	Yeah . 	
C	505.85	506.25	Yes . 	
B	507.6	507.79	Yeah . 	
A	508.94	522.53	Then we have the case material supplements . It's plastic . It's the cheapest one we need . So that's uh not much to save either . But then the biggest costs are the buttons . 	
A	523.09	539.22	So maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to uh keep our costs low . Because you have to we will have to get the twelve and a half Euros at the end . Um , 	
B	527.01	527.67	Okay . 	
B	530.79	531.0	Yeah . 	
A	540.91	552.82	so if we Let's fir first count the buttons we have now . Because I Sixteen . Nah , that will be even more then . Eighteen Euros . 	
B	543.35	543.801	Uh 	
B	545.05	546.4	Sixteen , I believe so . 	
A	556.26	556.97	So , 	
B	556.47	557.37	Uh seventeen . 	
A	558.37	559.04	seventeen . 	
D	558.84	559.373	Um 	
C	559.098	560.081		
B	559.58	560.74	Uh with the help button . 	
A	562.21	569.73	Okay , including the help ? Yeah . Uh seventeen . I think we can uh discard the help and the mute button 	
C	562.31	562.61	Yep . 	
D	563.03	563.42	Damn . 	
B	563.58	563.81	Yeah . 	
D	565.504	566.38		
A	570.93	575.77	uh by pressing down volume long , or pressing down a a number 	
B	576.64	576.992	. 	
C	577.11	577.33	Yep . 	
A	577.58	583.47	long . That saves us uh one Euro already . 'Cause then we have got fifteen I think ? 	
C	583.29	583.54	Yeah . 	
D	584.8	587.37	Wouldn't Yeah . No . That wouldn't be an option . 	
A	585.68	587.29	Fifteen buttons . 	
A	589.11	590.037	And this is 	
D	589.28	594.35	Uh , d I assume you'd count the volume and channel thingies for two buttons each , right ? 	
A	594.59	596.38	No those are one , I think . 	
B	595.75	596.09	Yeah . 	
D	597.67	600.16	Well , think actually there're two buttons , aren't they ? 	
B	597.97	598.905	Where did uh 	
B	599.56	603.362	Uh , it's just one button . But , um 	
B	604.47	615.125	Yeah . There were uh two uh for one big button . But they are uh more expensive than the small ones . Uh , yeah . So 	
A	614.4	625.82	Yeah but th it's not stated in this files . So maybe we can we can even make one button with the volume and the channel in one , by pressing 	
B	616.47	619.22	It's just a . 	
D	625.1	628.91	Well I was thinking , maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button . 	
A	630.46	631.89	That's possibility as well . 	
D	632.08	634.02	That would cut the cost . 	
A	634.97	638.449	So And it's good for the design as well . So you can make 	
A	639.82	643.735	Uh let's see . If you make this 	
A	658.544	662.83	Looks a bit like uh 	
A	664.33	666.208	a cross . 	
A	670.56	672.23	Plus . Min . 	
B	674.62	685.088	But I don't don't know if if it's cheaper . So uh , we've still got four buttons , but just um So 	
A	677.33	679.94	Uh s yeah channel . Yeah w 	
A	685.02	687.55	Yeah th I think they count uh the materials . 	
B	687.38	693.936	You got uh not not a butt button itself , but uh on the um 	
A	692.79	694.6	Yeah on the chip there . Yeah . 	
B	693.96	698.779	Yeah . On the chip you've got still uh four uh four buttons . So 	
C	694.59	694.91	Yeah . 	
D	695.88	696.17	Mm-hmm . 	
A	696.4	697.59	That's right . That's right . 	
D	698.45	698.87	Yeah . 	
A	698.93	706.123	But I think because we have the advanced chip we can just count this as one button . But No but I think 	
B	701.87	702.7	Yeah , but 	
D	701.929	702.488		
D	705.64	708.49	But , I think this really is four buttons anyhow . 	
C	709.17	709.69	Yes . 	
A	710.687	711.023		
A	711.7	731.66	Yeah . Maybe it is , but then it seems to me that it's impossible to get the twelve and a half Euros . Also the L_C_ display , I think it's , I think it's too expensive for the display we use . I think they uh try t 	
D	721.44	721.99	Yes . 	
C	723.86	725.31	Uh that's that's a big cost . 	
C	731.67	735.89	If we leave out the display we can also save money on the chip . 	
A	737.89	745.44	That's right , but what's the big advantage of our remote then ? 	
D	745.39	746.89	Only the docking station , I guess . 	
A	747.79	748.31	Yeah . 	
C	749.86	754.02	Which isn't the the docking station isn't even in this c s schematic . 	
A	755.41	759.92	No . That's extra . That's extra . That's right . 	
C	755.42	757.99	So it's not even taken into the price . 	
D	760.79	762.47	Maybe we should to a different supplier . 	
A	763.296	783.35	That's an option . Poland . Something . Polish supplier . Don't you think we can , if we can count this as v as one button , and integrate th uh these buttons in three , then we save a lot of money as well . 	
D	763.76	765.088		
D	767.744	768.76	Yeah . 	
C	782.535	789.09	We we could save money on it . But would it make the remote more usable for elderly people ? 	
B	788.966	789.577	. 	
D	789.98	792.601	Yeah , that's what I'm wondering . 	
C	791.61	794.32	My mother can't even send send an S_M_S_ message . 	
C	795.54	796.208	So 	
A	795.71	797.29	Yeah . That's a point . 	
B	796.525	796.972		
D	798.12	798.771	Um 	
B	798.53	804.032	Are we gonna buy a um a remote control uh when you can uh use it ? So um 	
B	805.86	806.28	Yeah . 	
B	807.95	819.056	We m uh we must um stay below the um below um twelve uh fifty or Can't uh go um 	
A	816.6	816.88	Yep . 	
C	816.71	816.9	Yeah . 	
A	819.47	819.82	No . 	
D	821.55	823.4	Well , since the market research 	
D	824.53	837.15	indicated that older people spend their money easier , more easy , maybe it's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little . Especially since we have those nice features . 	
B	835.49	835.78	Nay . 	
A	838.22	850.564	Yeah but uh we have to stick to the twelve and a half Euros . We don't have any more budget to develop it . Yeah . So 	
C	845.37	847.41	The margin will get too small . Yeah . 	
B	845.65	846.758	Is it impossible to 	
B	849.79	853.08	But it is possible to make one uh for uh twelve fifty . 	
B	854.05	854.86	I don't think so . 	
A	854.51	861.88	It is . If you leave out the L_C_ display . And if you use less buttons . 	
D	855.27	857.61	It would be a be a pretty rigid one . 	
B	856.51	856.81	S 	
B	860.45	860.73	Yeah . 	
B	862.4	862.704		
A	863.08	868.24	Say Or you can take the single chip . 	
D	863.936	865.195		
C	864.45	864.72	Ten . 	
B	864.75	867.696	But , you can't use uh 	
A	871.26	874.652	There it is . 	
B	872.34	872.67	Yeah . 	
C	873.344	873.888		
B	875.47	876.98	But we want to make a 	
B	877.088	883.26	uh so uh uh fancy and a good uh Yeah . 	
A	877.71	878.76	But then w 	
A	883.91	884.66	Good looking . 	
B	884.38	887.09	Uh , wi with n Oh , with uh 	
A	889.13	889.46	Yeah . 	
B	889.32	896.16	attractive uh o options . So uh , you can stay uh below uh twelve fifty . So 	
A	896.24	898.506	I think it's uh difficult as well , but 	
D	896.59	896.91	Or b 	
D	898.31	909.13	Basically becoming a choice between like either a good remote and a higher production cost , or just any other remote control . 	
C	907.2	908.781	No remote . 	
A	909.76	916.06	Or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers . 	
B	917.53	918.62	Scroll-wheel's one . 	
C	917.651	919.923	That's 	
A	917.74	918.15	Then w 	
A	918.95	930.822	Because then we save ten buttons . Then we have five and one . And and see . If we have this one and we've got the advanced 	
B	919.64	920.177	No , it 	
B	921.62	921.96	Yeah . 	
A	933.81	936.999	W uh , we're getting close . 	
C	934.3	935.35	We're getting closer . 	
B	935.76	936.743	Yeah . 	
D	938.2	940.17	But how does scroll-wheel work here ? 	
A	943.14	944.541	Then you will 	
A	948.17	949.56	Or maybe you can 	
A	952.17	960.61	um scroll . If you scroll you will see the numbers on the L_C_D_ display . Until you've got the right number , then you push it . 	
C	958.91	959.18	Yeah . 	
D	961.46	964.47	That would bring up the price of the scroll-wheel also . 	
A	965.64	972.89	Alright . It's gotta scroll and push . Okay but then you you can push uh some other button as well . 	
D	965.74	969.23	Integrated scroll-wheel push-button . But Yeah . 	
B	966.74	966.93	Mm . 	
C	973.81	976.08	You could just not scroll for a half a second . 	
A	976.69	982.88	Yeah . That's right . So if you scroll to a number and then you wait a half second , then it g turns to that channel . 	
C	977.48	979.15	So you won't need a button . 	
D	982.58	985.23	I think that would be like the end of our usability . 	
A	985.34	996.34	But it would definitely crop cost , a lot . And we need the battery . 	
B	985.7	987.491	D yeah . 	
C	985.739	986.932		
D	986.544	987.024		
D	991.89	992.672	Yeah , but 	
D	996.672	998.0		
A	998.753	999.089		
A	1001.14	1005.41	And the regular chip is not possible ? It has to be advanced ? 	
C	1006.79	1010.41	If you want to use an L_C_D_ screen you you need an advanced chip , yes . 	
A	1008.79	1016.74	It has to be advanced . Yeah . Okay . And we can save a Euro by a flat design . 	
B	1010.19	1010.48	Hmm . 	
A	1019.94	1025.11	That's an option we can Then we're almost there . 	
C	1021.27	1021.5	Yep . 	
B	1021.71	1022.09	Ja ja . 	
C	1026.12	1029.42	Yeah if you v could just leave out one more button . 	
A	1030.78	1033.13	Yeah . So if we 	
B	1033.24	1036.43	Yeah , or we have to uh skip the subtitle uh button . 	
C	1036.6	1037.05	Yeah . 	
A	1037.12	1040.976	Yeah but I think that's That is a big advantage , if we're 	
B	1037.51	1038.966	So Yeah 	
B	1040.4	1044.458	Yeah it's a big advantage . But um , it's 	
A	1042.21	1042.76	But 	
A	1043.76	1047.8	Can we use can't we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button ? 	
C	1048.45	1049.57	I think so . Yeah . 	
B	1048.54	1049.24	Uh , yeah . 	
D	1049.8	1060.59	Well , think it's pretty much the teletext subtitles are right now you just push the teletext button , go to page eight eight eight , and teletext disappears . But the subtitles stay there . 	
A	1049.87	1051.81	If you push it three times ? 	
B	1051.4	1051.86	Yeah . 	
A	1057.14	1057.75	Yeah . 	
B	1057.72	1058.02	Yeah . 	
B	1059.558	1060.154		
B	1061.63	1064.208	But if you push the teletext button twice 	
D	1062.39	1063.872	I think that's the case on most 	
C	1062.632	1070.562	What if you have to scroll to page eighty eight ? Eight hundred eighty eight . 	
B	1065.93	1066.49	It's uh 	
B	1068.91	1071.8	One m uh one b uh , a few buttons . 	
A	1068.99	1070.359	Ah that's not really that 	
D	1069.64	1074.98	Well , that could be just uh like the scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click . 	
C	1075.12	1076.15	Yeah . Okay . 	
D	1076.92	1083.76	But then again that would be d j just pretty much not an option for older people , who don't even know what a scroll-wheel is . 	
C	1082.29	1083.0	No . 	
B	1084.15	1084.66	Yeah . 	
D	1085.36	1086.04	Holding a 	
A	1085.73	1086.23	No . 	
D	1087.79	1093.49	remote with which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero . 	
C	1088.928	1090.68		
D	1096.36	1097.62	With only five buttons on it . 	
D	1099.76	1100.54	And a scroll-wheel . 	
A	1101.86	1114.59	I think if you make a good advertisement uh on television and in the in the guide , you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel . 	
A	1115.85	1117.38	If you just make it real simple . 	
A	1120.92	1130.97	Because it saves it saves a lot of money . And we can keep our L_C_D_ screen , which can provide extra information . How to use the scroll wheel . How to use the other bu buttons as subtitles . 	
D	1128.74	1129.6	True . True . 	
B	1131.0	1131.18	Hmm . 	
A	1133.17	1140.54	And it's good for the innovative design as well . If you would erase these . 	
A	1142.66	1144.55	Mm eraser ? 	
A	1157.62	1159.365	And we put uh 	
A	1167.03	1169.804	Looks a bit odd maybe . 	
D	1170.02	1171.43	That's a pretty big scroll wheel . 	
A	1182.02	1182.835	That is 	
A	1191.11	1203.01	Something like that . Then , yeah . We've got the scroll-wheel . One , two , three , four , five buttons , if we erase this one . 	
D	1193.083	1193.952		
A	1215.15	1216.6	And these are two buttons then . 	
C	1227.25	1232.992	We could make two buttons out of that . And just um 	
C	1234.33	1238.2	If you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll-wheel . 	
A	1236.15	1236.36	Yeah . 	
C	1239.89	1242.91	So that would save two buttons . If you do the same for the channel . 	
A	1241.9	1242.36	Yeah . 	
A	1243.85	1247.04	That's really a good good idea , I think . 	
A	1252.0	1257.42	And it will make the use of the scroll wheel uh more obvious indeed . 	
C	1255.41	1256.14	More obvious . 	
A	1259.8	1264.4	So we make one for the volume , one for the channel . 	
A	1271.82	1282.46	Plus scroll . That's right . So we've got one , two , three . Yeah , we can leave the teletext in if we want . 	
C	1274.99	1275.881	So if we 	
C	1282.78	1284.41	Yeah . So 	
B	1283.14	1283.31	Yeah . 	
A	1283.6	1284.85	That's m that's better . 	
D	1284.98	1286.21	So this is five buttons . 	
C	1285.75	1293.5	If we leave out all those buttons , perhaps you can go with the flat flat case . And make it smaller overall . 	
C	1295.2	1304.93	So if you put the the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on-off button , the screen right behi under that , than the scroll button 	
A	1295.28	1295.8	Y yeah . 	
A	1301.83	1302.37	Mm yeah . 	
A	1305.25	1307.063	Uh yeah , and then you can 	
C	1306.23	1308.01	you get a a much smaller remote . 	
B	1308.12	1308.45	Uh yeah . 	
A	1308.48	1309.03	That's right . 	
C	1310.28	1310.56	And it 	
A	1311.41	1312.0	So we can 	
C	1311.62	1311.9	sh 	
A	1313.32	1315.99	decrease this one to four buttons . 	
C	1317.08	1317.39	Yeah ? 	
D	1317.65	1318.84	Right now we have five . 	
B	1318.4	1333.808	But uh , you can make a f quite a big uh remote remote control for uh just the same price as a small one . Just uh you only have to pay for the double curved or single curved . It uh it's a bit uh 	
A	1327.12	1328.65	Yeah . That's no problem . 	
A	1332.22	1332.71	Yeah . 	
A	1334.1	1349.32	Yeah . It's uh it's more the moulds in which they are being made , I think . Single curved is really easy to just fill in . And cases come right out of the machine . And single curved you have to have a different uh different machine , than a flat one . 	
D	1339.24	1339.67	Mm . 	
B	1342.032	1342.624	. 	
A	1350.87	1354.25	I think this is a really easy one . Um , 	
A	1355.71	1363.68	what does everybody think about a flat or a single curved design ? Freek , what do you think ? 	
D	1364.74	1370.08	Well , I still think we should go for the single curve design . But then again , 	
C	1368.0	1368.4	Yeah . 	
B	1368.448	1368.912	. 	
C	1370.0	1372.23	Richard's argument was very good . Yeah . 	
D	1370.87	1376.01	all these changes are not really okay with me . But since 	
B	1370.99	1371.24	Yeah . 	
A	1371.48	1371.73	Yeah . 	
A	1373.9	1374.25	Yep . 	
A	1375.049	1375.886		
A	1377.07	1381.34	We have to cut costs . Yeah . Yeah I'm ag 	
D	1377.69	1378.65	we just have to . 	
B	1378.52	1378.79	Yeah . 	
D	1380.97	1382.55	I'd rather just go to the board and 	
A	1384.48	1385.44	Ask for more money . 	
D	1384.9	1387.82	get us to spend eighteen dollars a a remote . 	
A	1386.93	1387.35	Yeah . 	
A	1388.52	1390.75	Yeah . I am agreeing with the usability . Yeah . 	
D	1389.28	1392.28	Or do some market research and see what the options are . 	
A	1393.81	1415.83	Yeah . But th um I think we can then keep the single curved one . Just to express our L_C_D_ screen a bit more . So people will use it more , and especially for the help functions , it will be good if we have scroll bar , scroll button . It will be necessary to have good help function , as well . 	
C	1403.4	1403.68	Yep . 	
D	1403.4	1403.72	Yeah . 	
B	1404.32	1404.57	Yeah . 	
A	1423.86	1425.53	So this is scroll . 	
A	1436.29	1444.12	I think it was better to have this price list a bit earlier . Before we went on to the to the whole design . 	
D	1440.44	1442.221	Yes . Definitely . 	
B	1441.66	1442.15	The th 	
A	1445.56	1445.988	But 	
A	1446.94	1448.52	I'm glad we could make a bit . 	
D	1450.53	1450.89	Yeah . 	
A	1451.38	1454.87	It's pretty different , if you saw the last one than this one . 	
D	1452.32	1461.52	It's pretty different . But this is not really like for the group we were making our remote . This will really require a lot of marketing 	
B	1452.84	1456.529		
B	1458.81	1459.03	No . 	
A	1462.52	1463.58	Yeah . It will . 	
D	1463.22	1464.82	to get this to sell . 	
A	1465.64	1465.85	Yeah . 	
B	1467.184	1468.819	But um 	
D	1467.99	1474.26	'Cause if older people like familiar forms and familiar stuff . This is not familiar for them . 	
A	1475.66	1476.928	No , but I think 	
D	1476.16	1478.3	So we're gonna have to do a lotta convincing them . 	
A	1478.24	1479.216	I think the most 	
B	1479.23	1488.48	But they know the scroll-buttons from uh old radios . Uh they cal also uh buttons like that for uh changing uh channels . So maybe it's uh 	
D	1485.53	1485.95	Yeah . 	
A	1485.54	1498.82	That's right . We can let l We can stick it out , a bit . Like a old old buttons . Maybe that's recognisable for them as well . Yeah . That's a good one . 	
B	1491.45	1492.56	Yeah . Yeah . 	
B	1496.68	1496.92	Yeah . 	
A	1499.52	1514.61	So , I'm afraid we have to move on . And it's uh it's b uh less frightening , I think . If they see this design they think oh , there are only five buttons , and uh But we will see . 	
B	1513.69	1514.05	Yeah . 	
D	1513.89	1515.8	That's true . Might uh might be confusing too . 	
A	1516.15	1518.04	Yeah . That's definitely right . 	
D	1517.2	1519.06	They'd be like , what ? Only five buttons ? 	
B	1517.25	1517.76	Mm-hmm . 	
A	1520.23	1520.65	Yeah . 	
B	1521.56	1523.41	But very special , so uh 	
A	1524.95	1527.687	I would buy it . 	
B	1526.177	1531.32		
C	1526.407	1527.597		
D	1526.461	1529.504	Yeah . But you're not sixty . 	
A	1528.29	1536.36	That's right . I would buy it if I was six . No I don't know . What it costs under twelve and a half Euros ? No ? 	
A	1537.54	1539.39	Uh , yes they are . 	
C	1539.448	1540.939		
B	1539.98	1541.712	No . 	
A	1540.66	1545.9	No . But we can go on with the project evaluation . 	
C	1545.39	1548.185		
D	1546.63	1546.94	Mm-hmm . 	
A	1549.64	1555.19	Let's see . I can sit down I think . We still have fifteen minutes left , so we're nice on schedule . 	
C	1555.76	1556.32	Yeah . 	
A	1557.34	1560.17	Um , the project process . 	
D	1560.26	1563.94	So um , I like set up all these criteria . 	
A	1562.468	1563.078		
D	1564.62	1566.42	And evaluation of the 	
A	1564.73	1569.72	Evaluation criteria . That's right . That was the the point I forgot . 	
D	1568.05	1568.46	thingy . 	
D	1570.144	1571.568		
A	1570.73	1571.488	I should 	
C	1570.752	1571.765		
A	1573.09	1585.959	There we are . Evaluation criteria . Go ahead . We've got five minutes I think for those criteria . No we've got fifteen minutes but 	
D	1575.64	1577.552	Thank you . 	
B	1576.083	1577.424		
C	1576.704	1578.288		
D	1582.26	1583.39	Five more minutes ? 	
D	1585.68	1586.16	Okay . 	
A	1596.54	1597.42	Uh yes . What ? 	
D	1603.1	1608.65	'Kay so I did some literature study study , and analysis of the requirements we set up earlier . 	
A	1608.99	1609.39	Uh yeah . 	
D	1609.7	1622.32	Translated it into criteria , which would be these . Um , is the remote fancy ? The shape , look and feel . Innovative ? What new functions are there ? Uh , easy to use ? 	
D	1623.6	1638.25	Uh , learnability is a very important factor here . Uh , is it functional ? Are there not too many functions uh among the functions ? And are the those functions that are there , are they useful ? And the cost . 	
D	1640.8	1655.36	The target group . Is the remote really for the group we're making it for ? And recognability . If our company is If it is easily recognisable that our company made it ? 	
D	1657.05	1657.584	And 	
D	1659.03	1660.81	So we're supposed to evaluate it right now . 	
A	1661.82	1662.15	Okay . 	
D	1664.23	1664.71	Let's see . 	
D	1667.41	1672.6	Oh I have to say this was a little hard , because the minutes of our last meeting 	
D	1673.71	1674.25	were not here . 	
A	1674.19	1684.09	Yeah , that's because my pen failed to upload his data . I tried to but it's uh it's giving errors by downloading the software . 	
B	1674.77	1674.99	Mm . 	
D	1677.99	1678.43	Okay . 	
B	1678.14	1679.112	Yeah ? 	
D	1679.47	1680.09	Interesting . 	
D	1683.31	1685.047	So 	
B	1684.08	1686.98	Mm . 'Kay . 	
D	1687.14	1690.01	Is the design fancy , on a scale of one to seven ? 	
A	1690.37	1691.51	I think it's fancy . 	
C	1692.56	1693.14	Six . 	
A	1693.45	1693.58	Yeah . 	
B	1694.28	1695.36	Uh six . Yeah . 	
D	1694.52	1696.6	We all go for six ? Good . 	
A	1695.27	1695.64	Six . 	
D	1701.05	1703.92	Um , is the design innovative ? 	
A	1704.37	1717.92	Very . Subtitles , buttons . Yeah . Seven . Yeah . So we've got twenty cents for our docking station , huh ? 	
B	1704.43	1706.1	Mm . Sh 	
D	1705.1	1709.29	I think so , with our L_C_D_ screen , docking station , scroll-buttons . 	
C	1709.82	1710.12	Yeah . 	
B	1710.107	1710.703		
D	1711.02	1711.41	Seven ? 	
B	1711.66	1711.87	Yeah . 	
C	1715.408	1718.096		
B	1715.955	1717.111		
D	1716.912	1721.81	Should be do-able . Is the design easy to use ? 	
A	1719.5	1720.54	Yeah . That's right . 	
B	1722.42	1723.54	Mm . Not really . 	
A	1723.08	1725.77	That's a bit dodgy . 	
D	1725.62	1726.213	Well 	
D	1727.8	1729.298	Would be for us . But 	
B	1729.71	1731.132	For old people I I 	
A	1730.37	1735.28	I would say four . Four or five between . Between four or five . 	
C	1732.11	1733.19	Four or five . Yes . 	
B	1732.14	1734.4	W Yeah . Four . 	
D	1735.79	1736.66	I'd go for four , too . 	
B	1736.65	1736.85	Yeah . 	
A	1736.91	1737.13	Yeah . 	
A	1741.39	1742.36	Is it functional ? 	
D	1742.71	1747.14	Is the design functional ? Um , do we have all functions that we want to include ? 	
C	1742.769	1744.371		
A	1747.81	1748.47	Yes . 	
C	1747.949	1748.582		
B	1748.13	1748.66	N Yeah . 	
D	1748.49	1753.2	I think we do . Do we have too many functions ? I don't think so . It's pretty slim . 	
C	1750.88	1751.31	No . 	
A	1751.27	1751.75	No . 	
B	1751.36	1751.58	No . 	
A	1752.87	1754.1	Think it's uh seven . 	
D	1755.64	1756.0	Seven . 	
D	1758.44	1759.9	Oh , and do we um 	
D	1762.01	1768.336	take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control ? Like it getting lost and 	
B	1769.28	1770.45	Mm m 	
D	1769.83	1773.51	R_S_I_ influences ? Think we do . 	
C	1769.88	1771.47	Mm , we haven't thought of that one . 	
A	1772.35	1775.14	It was . I had them worked out . 	
A	1777.76	1782.76	Mm . They are ugly , not very functional , and getting lost . 	
D	1785.13	1788.49	Are the production costs within the preset limits ? Well they are now . 	
B	1785.3	1785.66	Yeah . 	
C	1787.778	1788.226		
A	1789.64	1789.85	Yeah . 	
C	1793.48	1795.791		
D	1794.99	1796.98	Does the design fit the group of focus ? 	
C	1798.51	1800.14	I think that's a three . 	
B	1798.81	1800.54	Mm , th yeah . 	
D	1799.744	1802.3	Yeah . I think it doesn't . 	
A	1800.97	1804.96	No I think with our new radio button , I think it's uh 	
B	1802.71	1803.05	Yeah . 	
B	1805.61	1806.112	Uh 	
A	1806.01	1806.79	I think it's better . 	
B	1807.49	1809.617	We have to test it s But 	
D	1808.15	1808.79	I don't know . 	
C	1809.175	1815.85	I still I think it's too m too fancy . Too too flashy . 	
D	1810.91	1811.522	I think 	
A	1811.67	1812.287	I think it 	
D	1815.18	1820.34	I think a radio button is not exactly what older people expect to have a remote control . 	
B	1820.37	1821.51	Uh , yeah , true . 	
A	1821.73	1822.03	Yeah . 	
A	1823.91	1824.95	I would give it a four . 	
D	1829.89	1831.72	I'm not sure . I think I'd go for two . 	
B	1832.16	1833.968	I go for three . So 	
A	1833.65	1836.56	Then we have to do the three . It's the 	
D	1835.63	1835.97	'Kay . 	
D	1843.52	1847.38	Is the company company recognisable ? Well , we have the logo there . 	
A	1845.83	1847.72	Yes it is . Yeah . 	
B	1846.0	1846.59	Yeah yeah .

D	1916.35	1918.34	Forty one out of forty nine . 	
A	1916.94	1917.5	Forty one . 	
A	1919.69	1920.466	That's

B	2072.22	2072.54	Yeah . 	
A	2074.65	2075.26	Nice . 	
C	2081.14	2086.87	The tasks are very structured , so you can just do step by step and it's very easy . 	
B	2085.52	2086.03	Mm-hmm . 	
D	2085.82	2086.15	Mm-hmm . 	
A	2089.232	2090.34	tasks . 	
A	2091.81	2092.15	Okay . 	
A	2093.63	2098.54	Were the means sufficient for the tasks uh we had to do ? Or were they too much ? 	
C	2099.5	2104.144	Well , the smart-board , the d d drawing is just a pain in the ass , but 	
B	2099.91	2100.49	Mm . 	
D	2104.368	2105.827		
B	2104.576	2106.011		
A	2105.36	2106.17	Smart-board . 	
C	2105.51	2107.74	The digital the digital pen is very nice . 	
B	2107.64	2107.85	Yeah . 	
A	2108.72	2112.376	If it wants to download its uh data . 	
D	2109.12	2111.665	Yeah . Yeah . 	
B	2109.31	2109.842	But 	
C	2110.55	2111.25	Yes . Yeah . 	
B	2111.2	2111.78	Uh 	
A	2117.93	2119.24	Failed download . 	
A	2123.84	2127.291	Smart-board was irritating . 	
A	2132.86	2138.62	So you rather wanted to have a flip-over ? Or something else ? 	
C	2138.11	2141.1	A flip-over or a more precise uh 	
B	2138.4	2140.345	Yeah . A flipper's uh easier , so 	
B	2141.52	2141.78	Yeah . 	
D	2142.04	2142.32	Yeah . 	
A	2142.35	2144.54	Faster as well , I think . Yeah . 	
C	2142.61	2143.61	digit Yes . 	
A	2149.52	2150.06	Flip-over . 	
B	2150.07	2173.624	But if you want to share uh of uh when you make um a picture like this uh on the presentation , it's easier to uh share it with uh other people . Uh so uh you can sh save it uh and uh put it on the internet , or uh uh in shared f uh folder or uh sh uh shared directory . So 	
A	2164.01	2164.34	Yeah . 	
D	2172.64	2175.73	Yeah , I tried to open the file on my laptop , but

D	2179.8	2180.13	Yeah . 	
B	2182.2	2185.71	T can uh can you export it uh like a Yeah . 	
A	2182.59	2187.6	But I think you can Yeah . Should be possible . Yeah you can export it as image . 	
D	2185.11	2185.78	no . 	
A	2188.65	2190.361	Must Yeah must be 	
D	2190.0	2190.96	Should've done that then . 	
A	2193.72	2196.74	So the sharing of the information was uh was okay ? 	
B	2194.014	2195.841	. 	
D	2198.12	2198.63	Pen is here . 	
C	2198.64	2199.15	Yes .

B	2218.91	2219.26	Okay . 	
A	2220.26	2223.83	That's nice . Have we found new ideas for 	
A	2225.51	2227.568	having this kind of meetings ? Or 	
B	2228.3	2238.992	Um , yeah maybe um uh when we n uh just uh give the numbers of of uh 	
B	2240.17	2255.648	Uh uh o one of uh out of s uh sev Um it's uh easier to uh to do the th things that are like that on a computer . Uh , so uh just l uh like uh at u university uh 	
A	2243.3	2243.75	Yeah . 	
A	2250.87	2251.17	Yeah . 	
A	2253.0	2253.492	So 	
A	2256.09	2267.74	Yeah . So everybody puts his own score . And then it mediates the score , and you can get one Yeah . That's better . So that's uh 	
B	2256.74	2257.141	So 	
D	2257.05	2257.43	Mm-hmm . 	
B	2258.54	2258.98	Yeah . 	
D	2259.27	2259.89	Yeah . 	
B	2261.71	2262.08	Yeah . 	
C	2263.41	2263.78	Yeah . 	
A	2269.02	2269.8	How do we call ? 	
A	2281.37	2281.97	Evaluation 	
A	2284.65	2285.49	criteria . 	
A	2294.79	2295.39	Okay . 	
A	2296.67	2301.87	Mm , any more ideas ? Or questions about the project ? Or about the product ? 	
B	2304.52	2305.19	Mm . 	
A	2308.37	2310.27	Because I think 	
A	2315.0	2318.42	then that we get to our last sheet . 	
A	2320.98	2322.25	Are the costs within the budget ? 	
B	2323.41	2323.75	Mm yeah . 	
C	2323.819	2325.011		
A	2324.36	2324.67	Yeah . 	
D	2324.9	2325.32	They are . 	
C	2325.682	2330.23	Considering we are not going to make a docking station . 	
A	2326.48	2327.59	Do we 	
A	2330.05	2339.42	Docking station . That's a good point . But maybe because of the docking station the price of the remote can also be a little bit higher ? 	
B	2332.04	2332.599	. 	
D	2340.69	2341.05	Yeah . 	
A	2341.47	2344.59	Uh and I think you can compensate that as well . 	
C	2341.57	2341.99	Perhaps . 	
B	2345.04	2345.31	Mm . 	
A	2345.86	2350.53	So I think that shouldn't be the biggest problem , because it's very cheap to make as well . 	
C	2350.92	2351.35	Mm-hmm . 	
B	2351.62	2351.98	Yeah . 	
A	2352.06	2369.96	Do we think we gonna get the twelve and a half million ? Or what was it ? Fifteen fifteen million . I think we will . If we gonna export this product . It's innovative . Especially in America . People are pretty decadent . 	
D	2356.57	2357.67	Fifty grand . 	
D	2364.31	2364.58	Yeah . 	
B	2369.57	2370.66	Yeah . Mm . 	
C	2371.014	2371.523		
A	2371.18	2371.85	Sometimes . 	
D	2372.64	2376.26	Yeah , still I think I mean if we're n gonna make a scroll-button anyway 	
B	2373.13	2373.45	Yeah . 	
A	2378.12	2379.24	You can do more . 	
D	2378.12	2384.05	it'd be more for the younger people than for the older people . So maybe we should just re-focus . 	
A	2381.84	2382.16	Yeah . 	
B	2381.92	2382.18	Ah . 	
A	2385.17	2409.6	Just put it on the market for everybody . You can you can change markets where by changing the front covers . That's one thing you can change it with . So you can also try to uh reach the younger people by uh putting fancy covers on on the market . Just as a test . See how it works . That's I think a good advantage . 	
B	2387.97	2388.0	Ah . 	
D	2387.97	2390.04	Or specifically for younger people . 	
B	2394.1	2394.28	Ah . 	
D	2395.02	2395.63	That's true . 	
D	2409.19	2417.58	Yeah , I think then it would be way more uh popular with younger people than it is , than would be with 	
D	2419.22	2419.97	older people . 	
A	2420.39	2420.74	Yeah . 	
D	2421.63	2423.25	Even if it were their covers . 	
B	2423.72	2423.91	Hmm . 	
A	2423.84	2428.89	Uh , uh then I think we can have our little celebration , right now . 	
D	2425.58	2427.286	But 	
B	2428.848	2432.048		
D	2429.856	2431.22	Party party . 	
A	2430.08	2439.07	That's it . Yeah . I think we still have to fit in one more questionnaire . I think . I don't know . I didn't get a message 	
B	2434.1	2434.97	Where's the champagne ? 	
D	2435.3	2435.57	'Kay .

B	2448.15	2448.51	Okay . 	
A	2451.41	2462.56	Then we still have some questions . If somebody has some questions they can ask them now . Or we can put these in the project folder as well . Maybe that's 	
D	2461.76	2462.09	Mm-hmm . 	
B	2462.55	2462.76	Yeah . 	
C	2462.779	2464.195
