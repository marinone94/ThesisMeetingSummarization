A	37.38	52.55	Okay . Uh door is closed . Well , let's begin . Because if we have as much time as the last uh meeting , we'll have to hurry up . Um well I'll start with the presentation again , the agenda . 	
C	38.809	39.506		
D	43.59	44.05	I'm listening . 	
D	46.59	47.1	Right . 	
C	46.72	47.384		
C	50.968	51.366		
D	51.57	51.95	Great . 	
A	57.51	57.93	Yo . 	
A	62.15	72.51	So . Uh This one I think . Uh yeah . Well alright . 	
D	68.064	69.184		
A	73.82	87.077	Um well , I'll show you the notes . It's not as uh interesting as it should be because we just uh had the meeting , but I'll show them . We'll get your presentations again on the conceptual design . Um 	
D	78.139	80.462		
A	87.55	105.88	Then we'll have to dec decide about the control , the remote control concepts . I've put a f uh a file in the project management folder , which says exactly uh what kind of decisions we should take . So this time we exactly know what to decide about . And then we'll close again . 	
C	91.93	92.23	Mm-hmm . 	
D	102.512	104.85	Alright , great . 	
C	106.3	106.69	Alright . 	
A	107.19	107.6	Uh 	
A	109.61	114.88	Well these are some examples , but we'll talk about them later . We'll first look at your uh presentations . Alright ? 	
C	113.79	114.26	Mm-hmm . 	
A	116.71	118.95	Walter will uh start again this time ? 	
D	118.23	118.76	Yeah , great . 	
A	120.4	120.73	Yo . 	
D	120.97	122.55	Alright , Trendwatch . 	
A	123.53	124.03	'Kay . 	
D	132.016	133.0		
A	133.187	134.368		
D	138.1	138.28	Right . 	
D	141.51	156.55	I will speak about uh latest trends trends , latest fashion updates , and uh things we must not do . Uh the trends . It's very important that uh the control is fancy looking and good uh feeling . 	
A	148.72	148.88	'Kay . 	
D	157.49	177.99	Uh this because of our last model was very functional , but it uh people didn't like that , so our new mo model must be very good-looking . That's uh something you uh have to take a look at . And uh the feeling has to be very great . Also the menus and things like that they have to they have to feel great . 	
C	170.58	171.73	Mm-hmm . Alright . 	
C	178.26	178.56	Alright . 	
D	178.52	196.07	Um there's a minus uh two times here , because this is the most important point . This is uh two times as less important , and uh same for this one . Um , technological technological innovations , that's uh regarded very highly too . 	
A	185.65	187.049	Less . 	
C	186.308	187.303		
A	190.234	192.259		
D	196.382	207.856	Uh such as an uh L_C_D_ screen , uh speech uh acknowledgement , as we uh talked about earlier . So we have to have uh something like that , like we uh 	
A	203.16	203.81	Well , yeah . 	
A	207.78	210.78	L_C_D_ and our uh our fronts . 	
D	211.32	222.15	Right . Uh the last point is easy to use . Well I think that uh speaks for s for itself . I don't know who's uh who's going to look at that . Yeah ? 	
C	220.88	223.02	Easy to use ? I think that's your ta 	
A	221.54	232.416	Well , easy to use uh s is a bit uh contradictionary with the first uh Functional is not an issue , and then easy to use . Well we have to choose one of them . 	
B	223.638	226.492		
D	228.56	229.38	Yeah , I know . 	
D	232.37	238.16	I think we have to go for the first one . It's the most important one . So we have to uh take that one . 	
A	233.7	235.264	Yeah . 	
C	234.15	234.45	Mm . 	
A	238.4	238.84	Okay . 	
D	239.35	246.59	So it it it isn't very important that that it works easy . But it has to look great . 	
B	245.03	248.02	Well something fancy looking can be can be easy to use . 	
C	245.399	245.996		
A	248.61	252.33	Yeah . We'll we'll look at uh . 	
D	251.46	253.761	We'll see . 	
C	251.63	261.33	You Yeah . Yeah , yeah , you can make a very complicated uh uh remote anyway , so ease of use It's not a very comp complicated device . 	
D	257.56	258.2	Yeah , right . 	
D	260.04	274.34	But the most important thing is that it looks great and people say wow , that's real great uh great concept . Alright . Uh these are the new colours of this year . So it must be very bright , very colourful . People like this . 	
C	266.24	266.77	Alright . 	
A	266.48	266.69	'Kay . 	
C	270.56	271.612		
B	271.002	271.699		
A	271.645	272.873		
C	273.12	275.66		
A	274.272	276.889		
B	274.56	274.96		
D	275.67	290.253	So we we have to think uh in this direction . So i set your mind to it . Findings ? Fashion update ? Fruit and vegetables are cool . I am told . 	
A	278.99	279.776	So 	
B	280.692	281.389		
A	281.88	282.331	Well 	
C	287.693	292.43	Uh you think ? 	
A	288.608	290.329		
B	289.686	290.582		
D	290.43	320.0	The group we are targeting is uh very pleased with fruit and vegetables . So we we we might cons consider in front of uh in in that sort of uh way . Uh furthermore uh material , that's your part , should be very strong . I was thinking of something like uh well uh iron plate over it , maybe in a colour or something , that looks so f really flashy but it it is also strong . And that's uh also for the younger public . 	
C	293.6	294.662		
C	295.492	297.151		
A	301.33	302.209	Yeah , well 	
B	302.49	303.41	Bananas . 	
C	312.41	312.96	Mm . 	
A	313.45	313.94	Yeah . 	
C	316.189	317.284		
A	317.54	317.6	B 	
A	320.34	328.38	Well the the handy thing about our fronts is that we can follow these trends e ev every year . Th this year it's fruits but next year it's it's something totally different . 	
D	327.16	338.27	Yeah , that's great . But I think we can all make the the fronts of titanium or something uh really thin . So it looks very heavy but you can still uh use it very easily . 	
B	328.46	328.73	Yeah . 	
A	332.86	333.42	Yes . 	
C	338.45	338.68	Mm . 	
A	338.51	339.29	Yep , alright . 	
D	339.93	356.56	Well , the don'ts . Older people like dark colours and simple shapes . Well we don't want uh older people , we want young people . So uh we're gonna turn that around . We're gonna have real uh cool shapes and lots of colours . Right ? Okay . 	
B	346.818	350.528		
C	347.741	349.534		
A	348.976	350.27		
C	350.8	351.39	Alright . 	
A	356.1	357.8	Wood is popular . Aha . 	
D	357.92	358.7	We don't want wood . 	
A	358.976	360.96	Yeah yeah yeah . 	
C	359.14	360.93	Yeah , among the old people , yeah . 	
D	360.81	363.5	Old people . So , that's it for me . 	
A	363.52	368.5	Alright . Nice , uh well show us . 	
C	377.96	380.63	Right , I am going to tell you something about the components design . 	
C	384.37	399.8	Uh again I have uh put up the specification properties . This uh so um uh the different uh components of the of of the device . And the materials ? Um I have heard several things , so I uh I'll have to change that on the way . 	
C	400.44	412.96	But uh the case ? Uh I suggested uh in the previous meeting hard plastic . But uh as you indicated uh it should be strong . It should feel strong . So maybe plastic is not uh sufficient . We should move to uh something 	
D	405.92	407.29	Yeah , we should change that . 	
A	411.66	416.156	Well maybe it it it is , but it doesn't look strong . So maybe 	
C	415.58	422.944	Well yeah . Y Hard plastic i is of course uh pretty pretty tough , but it doesn't have a really really tough look . So 	
D	421.61	422.21	No no no . 	
A	422.26	427.702	But we still have to look at our price of course . Because uh if we want an L_C_D_ uh window etcetera uh 	
C	424.37	425.38	Yeah . Also Yeah . 	
C	427.18	442.81	Mm-hmm . But we'll return to that . Uh the buttons of course rubber , I think everyone agrees . And electrical cables , copper is all pretty basic stuff . The chips made of silicon , I guess . I think that's the best uh way to do it . And infra infrared l LED is uh just a simple bulb . 	
A	428.67	428.89	Yeah ? 	
D	438.514	440.339		
A	438.919	439.649		
C	444.63	465.43	Then I've uh had a few findings , made a few findings . Uh the target audience product style . Um it's uh um generally the case that uh senior and wealthy people above uh forty five years old uh like , as you said , uh particularly the traditional materials as such as wood and materials such as that . 	
C	465.96	488.24	They also like straightforward shapes and luxurious style . But of course that's not our uh things this . So this is things we must not do . And then we have uh young uh and dynamic uh people , which is of course our uh group , the people we aim at . Um under forty five years old . Uh they like soft materials uh with primary colours . 	
A	473.52	473.85	Yes . 	
C	488.57	504.11	Soft materials is of course uh agai again a bit a contradiction with uh our uh material choice of what you said , that uh it should be hard an and and and and strong looking . But they like soft materials , uh so we might uh we have to consider that . And 	
D	498.69	499.41	Mm . Yeah . 	
B	499.68	500.0	Yeah . 	
C	504.57	518.88	also they like curved round shapes . So not uh too formal like like uh the older people want . And if uh also a finding but not very ap applicable here , that sports and gaming devices such as uh 	
C	519.11	529.09	discmans for jogging and that those kind of devices , gaming devices , should define the characteristics of the device . But uh since we don't have a really a sports or gaming device , so we don't really have to consider that . 	
A	529.05	538.752	Sports uh , they're uh that uh are accessible on on your L_C_D_ uh window uh Huh ? That's nice . 	
B	532.4	534.97	Soccer fronts . Mm . 	
D	533.666	537.815		
C	535.85	536.21	Mm . 	
B	538.47	538.59	Hmm . 	
C	539.81	541.91	Well I also have um 	
A	539.92	541.03	All the results ? 	
D	541.15	543.83	We keep coming back to the fronts . 	
A	542.568	543.431		
B	543.0	543.823	Yeah . 	
C	543.88	549.55	several examples of uh styles , so you can get a clear picture of uh what I mean . 	
A	548.91	549.36	Yeah . 	
C	551.01	556.29	Uh these are the basic uh older older peoples' stuff . 	
B	556.426	557.389		
D	556.573	557.48	Yeah . 	
A	556.94	557.38	Yeah . 	
C	557.9	581.55	It was not very uh interesting uh , very classical looking , but that's n that's not what we want . We have these kind of things . I don't know what exactly they are . It looks like Well you know uh you recognise the shapes , it's very primary colours , uh bright colours and uh round shapes . You also uh see uh this device , it's not very round and Fruity of course . Yeah , it uh That's true . 	
A	561.37	567.08	Mm-hmm . Nai . Uh no . 	
B	562.72	563.01	Hmm . 	
D	563.608	579.59	Fruity . Fruity . 	
A	568.767	569.497		
A	572.119	576.101		
A	580.35	582.49	It's t terrible . Alright . 	
C	582.65	594.08	And uh well round shapes , primary colours . You can see it all here . And of course uh this famous device . I think as you know something uh some devices like this . So to give you an idea of uh 	
A	584.819	585.35		
A	586.8	587.04	Hmm ? 	
A	590.68	591.48	Yeah , alright . 	
D	592.63	596.24	Well it's got a strong look , this . Yeah . 	
C	595.22	601.92	This has a strong look . Although it's plastic , it's it's grey to to to give it iron look . That's uh 	
D	597.67	599.52	Yeah , it still has a strong look . 	
A	599.52	601.34	Yeah . And it's round . 	
D	601.6	603.14	But then you are losing your fruity colours . 	
C	603.81	605.37	Yeah . Well we have to make a 	
A	604.94	612.47	Well you can make th th th that middle ring can you you can make another colour . So uh those kind of things you can you can combine . 	
D	609.25	609.63	That's true . 	
C	610.18	633.524	Well we can't really make a round uh a round remote control . I don't think that's very practical , but But uh it's important to to uh to think about the colour . Because if we make it grey or or silvery looking , it it does make it a lot more uh does make it looking a lot more stronger . 'Cause if you look at this , it it doesn't look very very strong , becau But this is plastic , and and this too , but 	
A	615.25	616.15	No , it isn't . 	
A	619.56	620.0	Okay . 	
D	627.59	628.774	Yeah but the 	
A	627.69	627.89	Yes . 	
D	632.31	640.11	But it doesn't have to look strong . The the results are , the feel of the material is expected to be strongy . The feel . 	
C	638.99	642.261	The feel ? Uh alright . Well 	
A	641.78	642.85	So , if you ti 	
B	642.4	648.029	And it it doesn't have to be strong , also . Only the feel . 	
A	644.76	645.342	Well 	
D	644.89	646.28	Nah yeah the feel 	
A	646.21	652.97	You you Maybe you should have uh some some coloured titanium or something . So it it looks pretty but it feels strong . 	
B	650.319	651.116		
D	653.2	653.51	Right . 	
C	653.37	653.6	Mm-hmm . 	
B	653.9	654.41	Oh . 	
D	655.0	655.42	I agree . 	
C	655.1	672.37	And I Then I have some more findings . Um uh about the energy energy source of the of the device , uh I uh suggest uh the basic battery . I uh got some other um uh uh energy sources of course . But solar energy is not very practical inside a house , because you don't have a have a lot of uh sun . 	
D	671.112	674.165		
C	672.96	681.6	And uh kinetic and and and dynamos are are not very practical , I think , for uh for a simple remote , that's a bit , oh , that's a bit uh 	
D	678.479	682.752		
A	680.125	683.51	No titanium . 	
B	682.99	683.786		
C	683.92	700.97	That's a bit uh much . And I also suggest uh as a shape uh a double curved case . Uh the disadvantage of that that you can use no titanium . That that's the information I received . If you use the curved case , uh a curved case , double curved then you 	
A	687.194	688.347		
A	701.82	703.61	What do you exactly mean with double curved ? 	
C	702.15	720.75	can't use titanium . Now uh this uh to give it a more modern look . And uh now the the shape , yeah , a curved case . Um yeah I think uh sort of triangle-shaped bottom or something . Uh a more modern look not plain , long box style , but 	
B	704.212	704.909		
D	720.386	722.99	I dunno . 	
A	721.33	722.15	Double curved ? 	
C	722.638	732.66	I'll draw it , but maybe later . And it makes uh it gives it a more u user friendly shape , than if you have uh . Um anyway 	
B	723.05	726.625	Yeah . Yeah . 	
A	723.16	726.912	It it mean Yeah , well okay . 	
D	724.136	725.43		
D	732.366	736.116		
B	732.565	733.793		
C	732.94	743.77	Um f as uh for the buttons , simple push buttons . No uh otherwi uh no um difficult scroll things or some uh things like that , because it makes more complex and expensive . 	
C	744.36	764.416	And , uh as we agreed , we don't use a speaker or a sensor or um uh speak uh speech uh controlled device . Because it makes it also more complex and expensive . But we do use an L_C_D_ screen , so we uh we do have to consider uh of we have to use a more advanced chip , which is more complex and expensive . But 	
D	751.32	751.7	Yeah right . 	
D	753.2	756.338		
A	765.17	765.636	Well 	
C	765.73	767.601	It's worth the trouble I think , because 	
B	766.65	769.71	The buttons can be made of an uh a soft material . 	
B	770.73	771.71	Because people like that . 	
A	772.18	774.9	This soft material thing from uh Yeah . 	
C	773.17	778.82	Uh rubber is a soft material , I guess . Uh soft enough . So that's uh basically what I want to talk about . 	
D	774.56	775.6	Yeah . Right . 	
B	774.9	776.08	Yeah . Right . Yeah . 	
A	777.59	782.48	Alright . Okay . We will take that . And then uh Mike ? 	
A	794.33	794.83	Okay . 	
B	800.45	800.67	Yeah . 	
B	804.63	810.97	Well um nah the method um we will um include the buttons as we discussed uh earlier . 	
B	812.35	835.21	Um an L_C_D_ s screen will be implemented . Um we must decide where , this meeting . Um there are new developments in speech recognition um systems , um and they are already being uh used on uh coffee machines . And um well they're cheap , so we could use them now . 	
A	816.384	820.641		
D	817.81	819.469		
A	833.982	834.612	Oh 	
B	835.82	853.13	Um it's not really speech recognition , it's more um like you can um talk to the chip , uh record the message and record an answer , and then once you uh talk to the remote , then um he will a answer with the 	
A	836.3	836.95	That's interesting . 	
B	854.34	863.24	the prerecorded message that you left . So if I say hi Mike , and you have recorded uh hi Mike back , then you will get that . 	
C	856.72	858.1	Oh , yeah , I understand . Yeah . 	
D	856.77	857.56	Oh okay . 	
D	861.44	862.535		
A	862.52	867.98	Okay . But you can also say that , when you say something , it does some function . 	
D	863.38	863.81	Right . 	
B	867.4	873.73	No it doesn't does not do anything . But i it's just a Yeah it's it's cheap . 	
D	868.13	868.36	No . 	
A	868.88	869.23	Oh . 	
A	870.21	871.108	That's a bit uh 	
D	870.25	874.58	But that that makes it cheap . It's it's just a an extra function , and it's cheap . 	
C	872.33	873.074	Yeah . 	
A	872.66	877.05	Yes . I understand . But it has no functionality for our remote at all . 	
D	876.05	877.033	No but 	
B	876.43	878.59	No but that's the gadget they want , or the gimmicks . 	
D	877.69	880.43	Yeah , right . Young people love them . 	
C	878.97	881.76	But it it's n nice for young people . They like gadgets . Yeah . 	
B	880.68	885.22	Yes , we we should really uh include that one , I think . Um 	
D	881.23	881.84	Yeah , ple 	
D	883.45	883.83	Right . 	
C	884.23	885.03	If it's cheap . Yeah . 	
A	884.32	885.02	Hmm . 	
B	886.39	899.821	Well , as I said uh earlier I think the uh L_C_D_ screen should be uh positioned at the lower end of the remote . Um the buttons for screen width and general settings and uh and that kind of stuff 	
A	888.479	889.309		
D	898.448	901.306		
B	900.05	916.55	um we can also do let that kind of functions um be shown in the L_C_D_ screen , uh instead of uh extra buttons . I think young people and yeah w well every user would like that . 	
A	907.96	909.41	So you put a menu in the L_C_D_ ? 	
B	918.47	936.71	Um the buttons um should be positioned uh positioned the same way as they are on a , well , conventional remote , I think . For the learnability and uh well to keep it recognisable . A voice recognition can be uh implemented . 	
B	937.92	952.512	And uh I drew an example , but it did not work quite the well uh the way I wanted it to do . Hmm ? Well I have the I can draw it again , and I know what I did wrong . I didn't tick the note bo box in the . Um 	
C	938.404	939.2		
D	940.734	945.68	Alright . How How 	
C	943.14	945.56	Can you draw it now of uh Can you draw it now ? 	
A	944.82	945.1	Ah . 	
C	950.68	951.52	Mm . Alright . 	
D	952.61	955.98	How do you uh uh give input to the menu on the L_C_D_ screen ? 	
B	957.12	963.184	Um with the uh the up and down and and well buttons and the 	
D	961.52	965.16	Alright . So you have a menu button , and then you can go up and down . 	
B	964.78	967.7	Well I will draw what I had drawn on the screen . 	
A	964.8	968.61	But then we should also have an uh an Okay button . 	
D	968.71	969.32	Yeah right . 	
B	968.98	974.12	Yes . Um I shall draw this . If it uh works . 	
C	970.306	971.69	button , yeah . 	
A	976.59	979.92	Just uh There is already a blank . Yes ? So Yeah . 	
D	979.12	979.98	Yeah . 	
B	981.0	981.77	Mm so have I . 	
B	983.584	984.281		
D	983.696	985.2		
A	983.754	986.475		
B	985.9	986.32	Nah . 	
D	986.183	987.676	. 	
D	991.26	993.11	You have to push hard . 	
A	993.055	995.842		
D	993.849	994.546		
D	995.375	996.935		
C	1005.65	1007.15	I suggest a banana shape . 	
B	1007.514	1008.41		
A	1007.988	1008.685		
C	1008.65	1010.84	Because of the fruity uh fashion . 	
D	1008.67	1008.99	Yeah . 	
D	1010.22	1010.73	Yeah . 	
A	1011.64	1014.25	No m Next year that's out . 	
D	1012.224	1014.736		
C	1012.64	1013.97	Yellow and 	
B	1012.724	1013.355		
C	1014.94	1019.28	Yeah alright , yeah . Just a hunch . 	
A	1017.579	1018.768		
B	1020.7	1025.79	Well these little buttons are a bit difficult to uh draw uh 	
A	1024.14	1024.59	Yeah . 	
C	1026.5	1028.87	Those are the the cha the channel buttons of course ? 	
B	1027.02	1027.5	correct . 	
B	1028.27	1029.85	Yeah just uh the numbers . 	
B	1031.541	1032.271		
C	1033.27	1035.39	And then below is the L_C_D_ screen ? 	
C	1039.153	1039.917		
B	1039.34	1042.64	These these will be bigger in the the real design . 	
A	1041.619	1042.183		
C	1042.08	1042.93	Alright , yeah . 	
B	1044.23	1053.37	This must be the Okay button used to uh interact with the L_C_D_ screen . And with this you can uh , yes , go to through the menus and that can 	
C	1048.91	1049.32	Mm-hmm . 	
A	1050.81	1051.04	Yeah . 	
B	1054.47	1064.44	Um the video button should be uh an apart button , because you want it to uh t , yeah , to use it fast within one uh click . 	
D	1055.37	1056.15	You've 	
A	1058.44	1058.88	Yes . 	
D	1062.15	1062.61	Right . 	
A	1065.08	1066.28	And what's the menu button ? 	
D	1065.12	1067.13	And you you need a you need a speaker . 	
B	1065.26	1067.196	Um it's 	
D	1068.48	1070.15	For the 	
B	1068.61	1068.8	Hmm ? 	
B	1070.2	1076.356	This button can also be the Menu button , we use in the menus Well we we can add another button here , but 	
C	1073.114	1073.91		
A	1073.64	1076.55	But how did How do you get out of the menu then ? Yeah . 	
A	1077.83	1081.47	Maybe I you could j just do an an exit with Okay . Uh 	
C	1078.61	1087.07	Uh by pe pressing the menu button again . By pressing the menu button again , you go uh out . It's usual the the the d kind of the way it works . 	
D	1082.34	1083.6	Yeah . Yeah . 	
B	1082.81	1083.16	Yeah . 	
A	1085.13	1092.921	Yes , well but bec because when you push Menu you get in , and then you have to push Okay when you get to a choice . And 	
C	1088.14	1089.11	Yeah ? Yeah ? 	
B	1091.17	1092.981	Ah right . Well you you 	
C	1091.74	1094.97	Yeah . But you can men you can press menu again to get out . 	
A	1095.27	1098.994	Well that's also the Okay button . That's you you should have uh 	
B	1097.42	1102.83	No no , we we we should uh add uh a extra Menu button and this the Okay button . 	
C	1097.76	1098.16	No . 	
A	1101.38	1106.33	Or you can put in the L_C_D_'s uh window an option Get Out . 	
D	1106.84	1107.33	Exit . 	
A	1107.78	1108.23	Exit . 	
B	1108.27	1114.45	Ah once you have an extra Menu button , you don't need that that extra option . You have uh redundancy . 	
A	1112.28	1114.16	Well , it's just a choice . 	
D	1113.18	1119.64	But we need a we need a a recording recording button for the speech uh part . Or don't 	
C	1118.901	1119.73		
B	1119.22	1122.3	Yeah , if we decide to uh to implement that , maybe we should . 	
C	1121.62	1127.51	Why would you put it uh then , and where is the recording uh the microphone ? Where would you put it ? 	
B	1127.01	1130.52	Well they that could be anywhere . That's very small . It could be uh down here . 	
C	1133.04	1133.36	Uh-huh . 	
B	1133.52	1140.82	Um . Well , not here . I yeah I suggest here . But that's just a little gap . Yeah . 	
D	1139.29	1142.11	Right , and spea speaker at the back , or something . 	
C	1139.56	1140.36	Microphone , yeah . 	
B	1141.84	1146.38	Well the speaker and the microphone , I think , are the same uh little hole thingy . 	
C	1147.008	1155.88	Yeah I understand . Uh but uh we could uh d do , but it's perhaps more expensive , uh the speaker on the back or something . 	
A	1148.205	1149.698		
D	1148.288	1150.04	Alright . 	
B	1148.726	1149.67	Yeah . 	
B	1154.16	1154.82	Well i 	
B	1156.82	1163.888	Um there are a all already being implemented in in coffee machines , so they won't be uh very expensive . But 	
A	1164.33	1164.53	Huh ? 	
C	1165.13	1165.38	Alright . 	
D	1165.58	1166.05	Alright . 	
A	1166.33	1167.33	Yeah ? Okay . 	
B	1167.28	1172.12	This is my suggested design . Um Yes . 	
A	1168.53	1174.9	Well , okay , alright . Um then let's have a look at the decisions we are going to have to make . 	
B	1175.63	1187.019	And oh I think as you can see so , the L_C_D_ screen does look better uh at the lower end , or at the bottom . But 	
A	1182.68	1183.72	I'd I agree . 	
D	1184.2	1187.89	Yeah , fine . Move on . 	
A	1185.179	1188.531	Fine . 	
C	1187.64	1189.0	Well yeah yeah yeah . 	
A	1190.0	1190.32	Yeah . 	
B	1190.44	1193.664	Oh , um I had some uh examples . You can uh 	
A	1191.719	1192.549		
C	1192.73	1193.46	I can live with it . 	
A	1193.58	1193.95	Yes ? 	
D	1194.251	1195.38		
B	1194.651	1195.614	But 	
B	1197.61	1199.762	I did not like it very much , but 	
B	1201.49	1202.75	Well these are 	
A	1203.51	1203.98	Too big . 	
B	1203.89	1209.252	quite obvious , very ugly remote . Um 	
A	1206.719	1207.536		
D	1206.97	1207.3	Yeah . 	
C	1208.07	1209.91	They do they don't look fruity enough . 	
D	1209.648	1211.67	Nei They're n they're not trendy . 	
B	1210.1	1211.27	No , well th 	
A	1210.72	1211.75	They're all black . 	
B	1212.47	1217.88	Yeah . Well not all . 	
A	1216.127	1218.88	Hey , that one I like . 	
B	1218.8	1220.83	Uh this is for children but th 	
C	1218.87	1219.826	Tho Yeah those 	
D	1220.16	1221.17	It doesn't look strong . 	
B	1221.398	1222.09	No . 	
A	1221.53	1222.08	No . 	
C	1222.28	1223.908	But it doesn't uh the 	
B	1223.42	1226.27	W but with the colours i it's a bit the way we're going to . 	
A	1223.859	1228.34	The remote . 	
D	1226.42	1226.87	Yeah right . 	
C	1226.87	1227.63	Yeah , ok Yeah . 	
B	1227.62	1229.936	Well this is a terrible 	
A	1228.96	1229.41	Terrible . 	
D	1229.41	1230.38	This is just crazy . 	
C	1231.408	1235.21	But it it must not look too childish of course huh ? 	
A	1231.96	1234.744	It's it's all too much buttons . Too many buttons . That's 	
B	1232.13	1242.573	Um this looks Yeah . This uh these are the L_C_D_ screens . I think we should , if it's um possible , uh one with colours , but 	
D	1242.77	1246.07	Nah th It's too expensive . Yeah . 	
B	1243.47	1246.18	I don't know uh Too expensive ? Alright . 	
A	1243.99	1245.57	Well , that's too expensive I think . 	
B	1247.72	1248.93	Well Nah . 	
C	1247.97	1249.257	But it Yeah . 	
A	1248.07	1249.67	Alright . Yeah . 	
A	1250.78	1251.23	Okay . 	
B	1252.54	1254.06	Ha , even more . N 	
A	1252.58	1252.8	Huh . 	
A	1254.43	1256.784	Mm no . 	
D	1257.73	1259.89	But are we going for a strange uh form ? 	
A	1257.78	1258.07	'Kay . 	
A	1261.3	1262.7	No , not very strange . 	
D	1261.56	1262.42	'Cause people like that . 	
C	1262.63	1265.09	Not not too strange . No . 	
D	1263.82	1269.08	Not too strange . You can make the the underside , you can make it more round , where the L_C_D_ is . 	
A	1264.38	1265.06	It still has t 	
A	1267.52	1272.0	Yes . Th a a kind of bridge . So it f falls over the hand . 	
D	1270.41	1277.75	I dunno if you know the No Nokia telephone , with uh the round uh thing at at the bottoms , s something like that . 	
B	1270.48	1271.052	Well 	
A	1274.87	1275.76	Yeah ? Yeah ? 	
A	1278.76	1279.17	Yeah . 	
D	1278.86	1280.25	You know ? 	
A	1280.06	1290.94	Well I have at home a remote with a bridge . It's just a half round half half circle at And then it falls exactly over the hand , and that's very nice . That's It feels comfortable . 	
D	1291.87	1297.99	Yeah , but people like something uh new you know . Yeah , different . Y yis 	
C	1294.42	1301.01	Exotic yeah . We have t Yeah , yeah . I will design it , we design it later . So we'll get to that later I guess . 	
A	1296.93	1297.21	Yeah . 	
D	1299.89	1300.9	Alright . Great . 	
A	1300.87	1307.64	Yeah , alright . Um where did I put it ? Um conceptual phase , I think this is it . 	
C	1303.92	1305.796	The specific shape . The 	
B	1305.445	1306.241		
A	1309.93	1317.82	I got this from our friends . So Uh yeah the conceptual design . 	
B	1313.044	1313.808		
C	1314.085	1316.32	Our sources . 	
A	1319.31	1330.05	These are a few examples which we have to decide about . All the the materials from the case , uh the electric cable that's all your uh your side of the story . 	
A	1331.08	1331.71	Um 	
D	1331.47	1333.48	Your bag . 	
A	1332.592	1344.352	Yeah . Um now from the user interface , your uh package ? Um where No well , that's more like the buttons where they have to come . And um 	
A	1345.59	1349.46	B a bit of , yeah well , a bit of uh design . 	
B	1350.1	1353.64	Yeah , this is what we've just done . Right ? 	
C	1352.85	1354.15	But uh we should decide now . 	
A	1352.96	1363.34	Yes , but we have to decide about these now . And uh the trend-watching . So as you said , fruity is in , well sells good . Wow . Uh these things . 	
B	1354.52	1355.21	Ah right . 	
D	1354.96	1358.03	Yeah . Materials are the most , most impor 	
B	1360.37	1361.134		
D	1361.53	1362.16	Yeah . 	
C	1363.49	1365.89	So we have to uh put it in one uh document . 	
A	1366.59	1369.968	Uh yes . Um so if we uh go through them 	
C	1369.59	1377.23	Copy paste uh this story into a into a Word document , and then uh put the answers after the subjects . Yeah . 	
A	1378.841	1379.504		
B	1380.14	1380.87	Not everything . 	
C	1382.38	1383.88	Well we have to decide all these things ? 	
B	1384.08	1387.3	Yeah but all these examples are uh of a coffee machine . 	
A	1387.84	1388.688	Yeah well uh 	
C	1389.92	1392.04	W we can uh override them ? 	
A	1390.13	1391.119	Why should I uh 	
D	1391.594	1392.423		
A	1392.19	1392.51	Yeah . 	
D	1393.419	1395.078		
A	1394.93	1395.4	So 	
C	1395.7	1401.144	Well a case ? Uh that's me . Uh I suggest Well what do I suggest actually ? 	
A	1399.86	1403.9	What what kind of properties should it have ? Well we just listened . 	
C	1402.405	1406.12	Uh s solid , yeah . Yeah . 	
B	1404.01	1415.984	I think we Why don't we um use uh titanium or or a hard , yeah , some kind of metal for the uh the the whole remote except the front . That 	
D	1413.43	1414.59	Do you know the new uh 	
B	1417.57	1420.83	Just like um most cell phones are . 	
C	1418.64	1423.788	Yeah , I understand . Yeah . So we have titanium . 	
D	1418.8	1420.32	No no 	
D	1423.07	1424.57	The front is the most important . 	
C	1424.551	1439.38	Yeah but the non-removable elements of the of the remote , so not the front , could be titanium , to give that uh strong look . And then the front is made of plastic . And you can put that on and off , and switch it . 	
B	1432.23	1432.67	Yeah . 	
A	1433.55	1434.29	You know what ? 	
B	1441.08	1441.62	Yeah . 	
D	1441.37	1443.878	But the feel of plastic isn't strong . 	
C	1443.29	1447.95	No but you have titanium of course . Uh you have the best of both worlds . 	
B	1443.8	1445.36	No but you you have this Yeah . 	
D	1446.44	1448.61	Yeah alright , alright . 'Kay . 	
B	1448.58	1454.907	Yeah , you have the re remote in your hand like this . So you feel titanium . 	
C	1453.66	1458.28	And of course , yeah , you have the the the plastic front end . But you also have the titanium . 	
D	1456.47	1460.59	Yeah . Fronts are are cheaper than when they're from plas 	
B	1459.63	1459.88	Yeah . 	
C	1459.96	1462.03	Yeah of course , but yeah you have to make a 	
B	1463.36	1466.46	And I don't know if you can make steel just any way you want it to . 	
C	1463.72	1464.36	decision . 	
D	1467.71	1469.63	Yeah , but it it's expensive . 	
C	1469.17	1471.759	I guess so . Uh titanium I sh I think uh 	
B	1469.9	1470.51	Yeah . 	
D	1471.6	1473.88	Bendable . Bendable . 	
C	1472.67	1474.248	Huh ? Well , well the 	
B	1474.24	1475.791	Well any colour 	
C	1476.39	1486.3	According to my sources , uh it's it's totally possible to make an entire uh uh uh Titanium is available , and uh we can uh make uh an entire remote out of it , if we want . 	
B	1486.02	1492.04	Yeah , then you you paint it in the colour you want it . The plastic is is the colour you want it . 	
D	1488.83	1489.18	Yeah . 	
C	1488.92	1489.17	Mm . 	
D	1490.25	1490.88	Paint spray . 	
C	1491.52	1492.03	Mm . 	
D	1492.33	1492.81	Yeah alright . 	
B	1494.28	1495.09	So Yeah . 	
D	1495.46	1498.7	So , we're going for a titanium back and a plastic front ? 	
A	1495.88	1496.43	Alright . 	
A	1497.98	1498.744	I've uh 	
C	1498.78	1501.71	Yeah , I think that's a nice trade-off . 	
B	1499.19	1499.37	Mm . 	
A	1499.75	1519.25	Titanium back , plastic front . Okay . Um well I am going to put it in here , uh because we can uh look . I Um solid feel and trendy look . So material , um hard plastic for the front ? 	
D	1505.91	1506.58	Yeah , great . 	
B	1506.61	1506.92	Yeah . 	
C	1507.4	1507.64	Alright . 	
C	1518.45	1520.9	Yeah , for the front and then titanium for the back . 	
D	1519.49	1519.93	Yeah . 	
C	1522.52	1524.3	For the non-removable uh part . 	
D	1524.37	1534.26	But then you have the problem , when you have a titanium back , you can't switch it . When you want an other colour on the front , it doesn't match . You know ? 	
C	1533.82	1534.746	Well but 	
B	1534.24	1536.703	Well titanium is neutral . 	
C	1535.9	1554.78	The titan titanium isn't isn't v very Yeah , i it doesn't uh curves . No uh I nei . Titanium is very No no no , but you know b Titanium is very basic colour , and it doesn't really matter if we have a purple front on it or a orange front . I dunno if if you disagree , but I think it's doesn't matter very much . 	
D	1541.039	1547.98	I understand . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Yeah . 	
A	1541.646	1545.562		
B	1541.721	1545.936		
B	1547.79	1548.13	Hmm . 	
B	1549.65	1549.93	Yeah .

C	1605.952	1608.35	Right ? 	
D	1605.985	1608.54		
A	1608.43	1624.28	The chip is normal silicon . Uh the buttons are normal , etcetera . Okay ? So that's just easy . Uh we decide about that just by looking at our competitors and our earlier uh remotes . The conceptual specification of the user interface ? 	
C	1609.584	1609.968		
D	1611.072	1613.617		
C	1613.7	1615.13	Alright . Mm-hmm .

C	1656.11	1657.75	Yeah the the the front w 	
D	1656.94	1668.592	I think we can launch a couple of packages . You can buy a different kind of of of machine , but it's the same thing , but with another front . So 	
B	1661.23	1661.72	Yeah . 	
A	1667.73	1676.91	Yes . We can also uh implement um we can also implement fronts from um movies that are very hot . Uh those kind of things . 	
C	1667.96	1668.27	Mm-hmm . 	
B	1669.22	1671.04	Yeah that's the whole idea of the front .

A	1691.89	1693.68	Launch different lines at once . 	
C	1691.93	1698.905	So e th then a c couple of basic colours . Not not very uh sim Not 	
D	1695.78	1702.627	Yeah , n not too heavy . You can always take another pick . 	
C	1700.29	1700.65	Yeah .

C	1752.19	1758.304	Uh we still have to make We have still have to make the es the the real basic design . Because yeah we have the sketch but 	
D	1756.58	1764.11	Yeah . But we we must remember that fancy look-and-feel is the most important thing . Else it w won't sell . So 	
A	1761.94	1762.46	Yes .

A	1862.592	1868.89	, what are you going to do ? Uh I don't know what product evaluation exactly means , but uh you'll get uh the specifications . 	
D	1869.21	1873.813	We don't have produ product yet , so kind of difficult . 	
A	1871.15	1872.534	Yeah . That's why I uh

B	1895.17	1906.58	And these uh these s these buttons uh are more uh triangle-ish shaped with a square one in the middle . Yeah . Yeah . 	
A	1899.99	1901.135	Why does 	
D	1902.11	1905.94	Curvy . Yeah . So you can see you have to up or down .

C	1923.32	1926.52	Well th th th th th that depends uh . 	
D	1924.4	1925.444	Yeah . 	
B	1924.94	1926.228	Yeah , it depends , but 	
C	1928.61	1929.706	Well we uh 	
B	1928.98	1932.367	If you turn up the volume , you always see this thingy go up . 	
C	1931.59	1935.44	We we j we'll just give them an uh We'll design it , and then they can give comments on it . 	
D	1932.55	1933.07	Yeah , that's right .

D	1943.03	1944.84	You can't uh click the corners . 	
A	1944.68	1953.6	No . It's a bit uh bit a pity . Well we still have uh more than five minutes . Um 	
B	1945.456	1946.386		
D	1947.9	1950.7	It's a real real great thing . 	
C	1953.664	1953.904		
A	1954.63	1956.73	So what are we going to do ? 	
A	1957.614	1958.211		
A	1959.22	1970.62	I as Project Manager ha don't have a clue . Oh we can uh decide how we implement the feeling from our company into the remote . 	
D	1959.725	1963.48	Let's start the design . 	
C	1970.58	1981.408	Well yeah . Um I think um a logo , our company logo , and the slogan should be or could be Yeah , why not ? If there's enough space , you can put uh We'll we'll 	
B	1970.81	1971.05	Mm . 	
A	1975.96	1977.771	Also the slogan ? On the 	
B	1980.66	1982.42	Uh I I'd say only the logo . 	
D	1981.01	1981.18	O 	
D	1982.8	1983.72	Yeah . Me too . 	
B	1984.0	1986.7	Too much text and it gets too too busy . 	
C	1985.6	1990.334	Well , our slogan is not very long . It's just a simple What is it ? 	
B	1988.34	1990.66	Well it's quite a long phrase . 	
A	1988.39	1990.31	We put the fashion in electronics . 	
A	1991.88	1993.12	We put the fashion in electronics . 	
D	1992.22	1995.57	But we kree we keep adjusting to the fashion 	
C	1993.288	1994.681	You c 	
D	1996.6	2000.079	with our fronts . So 	
C	1999.01	2004.239	But you can put it on the back , on the titanium part . The logo and the and the 	
D	2003.14	2004.21	Yeah , right . 	
B	2003.36	2005.93	Ah the logo should be on the top I think . 	
D	2004.85	2005.654	The logo 	
A	2006.74	2018.405	On the top . Yeah . Well in in in the right top corner ? And well you c On the back , you can put uh h At the bottom , you can put the logo with the 	
C	2008.34	2009.45	Yeah they do . Well yeah . 	
D	2009.09	2009.698	Yeah . 	
B	2010.16	2011.53	Right corner , yes . 	
C	2011.75	2014.63	Right corner , or maybe here in the middle ? 	
B	2018.854	2022.15	uh the text ? Yeah . Uh yeah , at the back ? 	
A	2020.19	2021.75	Yeah . Just just small . 	
D	2020.91	2024.9	But the logo the logo shouldn't be exchangeable , when you get off the front . 	
C	2024.38	2028.8	Yeah it it should be hard on the on the on the board , and you can remove the front . 	
B	2024.73	2030.62	Well you c Well uh Yes . You can The logo can be on on every uh front . 	
A	2025.34	2026.204	Yeah well 	
D	2026.41	2027.45	Yeah . Yeah . 	
D	2030.17	2033.74	Yeah , but you can scratch it off or something . It's better if you have it uh 	
B	2034.56	2038.93	Yeah , but then you must uh really uh yeah push it in or something . 	
A	2035.91	2037.38	Carved into the material . 	
A	2038.48	2042.09	No , you you can carve it into the titanium at the back . 	
C	2042.34	2048.112	I l I like the idea of the of the slogan on the on the on the thing . But am I the only one , or uh 	
B	2043.08	2043.854		
B	2046.87	2058.09	Yeah , on the backside . Well n n not not on the front side , I think . On the back Yes , you you can , yeah , push that in , so that it is always be there .

A	2051.5	2053.29	The front side , no no l no slogan . 	
C	2052.01	2053.867	No not on the front , but on the backside . Uh 	
A	2055.94	2056.56	Sorry . 	
C	2057.19	2063.17	I think it's a nice idea , to make it more recognisable , that the next to the logo you have the slogan . 	
D	2060.0	2060.493	Yeah . 	
B	2060.71	2060.91	Yeah . 	
D	2064.61	2065.11	I agree . 	
C	2065.33	2066.87	To make more uh of an impression . 	
D	2066.13	2066.92	But not too big . 	
D	2067.91	2070.03	Just uh Yeah . 	
C	2068.14	2074.9	Not too big . No , very small . Not on the entire back , but uh just very small . But readable enough of course . 	
D	2071.248	2072.011		
D	2075.75	2076.292	Okay . 	
A	2076.94	2079.07	Yes , slogan from 	
C	2077.27	2081.21	But we'll uh we'll take that uh with us into the design . 	
A	2080.09	2080.74	company 	
B	2080.15	2086.507	Yeah I think over here the logo . 	
C	2082.86	2086.2	Lo Uh yeah . Or maybe here in the middle , but we'll decide later . 	
A	2083.44	2084.54	on the back 	
A	2085.89	2088.33	with logo and 	
A	2089.7	2092.49	logo also on 	
A	2093.91	2101.502	the front but not exchange uh 	
A	2104.7	2112.03	Uh ? Hmm ? Uh when 	
D	2106.329	2109.714		
A	2113.03	2115.12	changing fronts . 	
A	2117.83	2119.13	Alright , that's decided . 	
C	2118.0	2120.5	Do you do you see a bit of the of the um 	
A	2120.75	2121.71	Five minutes left . 	
C	2122.46	2134.341	of the uh titanium ? O on the front ? Uh maybe if we make this this this lower part titanium , the front is the the upper part , and the the bit with the with the L_C_D_ screen . So 	
B	2126.0	2127.42	Yes we could 	
A	2134.36	2136.1	So a bit of titanium between ? 	
C	2136.5	2142.352	Yeah . No no betwe of between we can do but But then you have two parts of front , two fronts that 	
D	2136.51	2136.89	Yeah . 	
A	2137.69	2139.67	That's a bit Oh that that's that's pretty cool . 	
B	2140.45	2146.04	No , they have two fronts , that . You you can Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . 	
D	2140.9	2143.37	No no no no . You have to make this titanium too . 	
A	2142.52	2142.8	No ? 	
C	2144.25	2145.57	This enti entire bottom ? 	
D	2144.55	2152.13	Else you you get problems with the L_C_D_ . Like dust in it and so things like that . When you exchange all the fronts and it's open . 	
B	2147.13	2147.71	Yeah . 	
A	2147.22	2147.58	Yes . 	
B	2149.16	2149.6	Yeah .
