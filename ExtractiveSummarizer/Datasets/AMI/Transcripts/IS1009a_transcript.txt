A	196.38	202.4	All right . Here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve . Um . 	
A	203.78	218.2	That is it's gonna be individual work and then at the meeting we'll discuss what uh we have come up with . The same goes for the conceptual design , there will be individual work whic and then discussion afterwards .

C	347.072	348.31	Snake . 	
B	347.99	350.08	I'm going to draw a snake . 	
C	349.634	350.027		
B	355.86	359.062	How does it look like ? 	
A	355.92	360.45	Okay . Okay . 	
C	356.149	356.968

C	358.048	359.152		
D	359.99	364.988	I hope the kitty cat is hungry 'cause I don't like snakes . 	
C	361.776	362.576		
A	362.064	364.28		
B	362.24	362.72		
C	363.648	363.872		
A	367.25	375.93	Here's the project finance uh which , of course , we all have to think about when we design this thing . Um selling price is supposed to be twenty five Euro . 	
A	377.25	386.09	Uh profit aim for the company is fifty million Euro , the market range unlimited meaning international 	
D	377.48	377.93	Mm-hmm . 	
D	382.064	382.832		
D	386.53	387.02	Okay . 	
A	387.4	393.64	and the production cost should not exceed hopefully should be less than twelve fifty Euro . 	
D	395.23	398.51	Mm 'kay that should keep everybody on their toes and challenged . 	
A	398.76	399.29	Mm-hmm . 	
D	400.24	400.93	Profit . 	
D	402.86	406.48	Um is fifty mm . 	
A	403.81	412.67	So these are all things , of course , to remember with the budget and when you design to materials , cost , etcetera . 	
A	419.16	427.58	Now , uh the discussion I guess is um does anyone of you have experience with remote control ? 	
D	420.14	420.46	Oops . 	
C	428.69	431.54	Yeah , of course , using remote control . Yeah . 	
A	428.95	434.99	I exp I s 'cause we we use 'em we use 'em , right , everyday . And um 	
B	429.73	430.1	Yes . 	
A	436.56	449.23	now having used a remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you didn't like with it , things you would like to change , things you would like to improve with this thing ye any first ideas ? 	
A	450.37	460.58	Would you like it to be smaller , bigger , have more have more buttons on it or maybe clearly better marked buttons , you know , things like that ? 	
C	451.06	451.37	Uh . 	
B	453.94	454.426	Yeah , I 	
C	459.86	461.8	Yeah . Yeah . 	
B	461.46	486.73	Yes , I I feel that all the remote should be very compact . Yeah , those which we get here nowadays it's very long . And um and it should have multi-purpose . Like uh the remote control which we use for T_V_ , it shou uh it should be used f uh for some other purpose also , like controlling the uh temperature inside the house or for air-conditioners , or for heating system . 	
A	465.15	466.45	Small , right . Mm-hmm . 	
A	469.29	469.68	Mm-hmm . 	
A	481.37	482.62	Mm-hmm . 	
C	481.7	484.34	Audio player . Oh . Okay . 	
A	486.72	495.26	So it should be a multi-functional uh gadget that would um control all your household uh uh machines basically . 	
B	488.48	489.46	Yes , exactly 	
B	489.97	490.4	Yes . 	
C	490.4	490.46	Hmm . 	
B	492.57	492.92	Yes . 	
C	492.784	495.51	Divides us Yeah . Yeah . 	
B	494.72	495.68	Yeah . Exactly . 	
D	496.144	502.768	At um twelve fifty Euros per 	
B	501.744	502.256		
C	502.24	503.92		
A	502.77	503.46	Well . 	
D	503.78	506.75	Well who knows if we get a really good designer maybe we can do that . 	
C	506.18	506.79	Yeah . 	
D	507.808	513.57	We certainly can try to I agree with her that to market something successfully it should do some more things . 	
A	513.11	521.07	It should be something new it should be s it it should do something different than than just what we have . Now , of course , the other thing to think there is maybe the design . 	
D	517.36	517.76	That's right . 	
C	517.8	518.74	Yeah , of course . 	
B	518.13	518.5	Yeah . 	
B	521.06	525.449	Yeah , design should be , yeah it should be different . All the almost all the remotes 	
A	524.22	538.73	Like trendy no like f for earlier we saw maybe it should be something trendy you know . Maybe it should different colours or materials or you know . Um so yeah shapes right , you know , like kidney shape feels better in your hand or something , you know . 	
C	527.83	533.05	Yeah , maybe ten I do yeah , colours and al shapes also . Yeah . 	
B	527.9	528.82	Yes , exactly . 	
B	530.68	532.69	Are different shapes . Yes . 	
B	537.03	537.48	Yes . 	
C	538.09	539.24	Yeah of course yeah . 	
D	538.53	551.13	Yeah okay , friendly shape , that would help . I think another thing that would help is um if it beeps when you clap , because I think one of the big things that happens is people lose them . They can't find it . 	
A	539.97	540.33	Yeah . 	
A	544.12	544.57	Yes . 	
A	551.232	565.64	That is true , because they put a newspaper or they put it behind a plant or , we you know , whatever . And and they suddenly the phone rings and they want to turn the T_V_ off and they say , where the hell is my my remote control yeah ? 	
B	551.616	552.32		
D	553.216	554.048		
C	555.68	556.953	Yeah . 	
D	558.16	558.63	Mm-hmm . 	
C	563.941	564.54		
D	566.02	567.126	So some 	
A	566.14	575.931	Well or yeah or if it's really , if it's really in a dark spot that it gives out a a sound or a signal . Yeah . Mm-hmm . So if lost 	
C	572.01	574.726	Yeah , some beep or something like that , so that we can go 	
D	572.64	576.76	Uh so , so it's really the beep or , or a light should blink . 	
B	573.12	573.25	Or a b 	
A	576.74	581.45	If lost uh signal with b throw signal , you know . 	
B	577.04	577.78	Should ha 	
C	577.06	577.37	Yeah . 	
B	578.58	580.16	A fluorescent signal , yeah . 	
D	580.39	580.91	Mm 'kay . 	
C	581.48	586.34	Yeah , maybe it should have a light so that we can , we can just recognise where it is . Yeah , yeah . 	
A	585.68	592.608	Exactly , I mean just that's what I'm saying . I'm just saying throw signal meaning just whether it's a beep or whether a light or 	
C	587.0	587.95	May not be beep . 	
C	590.86	593.03	Beep or uh it's a light , maybe it's a light . 	
D	592.25	605.71	And do you think a good c c um clue for that is that it would respond to a clap or it would respond to your voice or it would respond what what should you have to do to make it beep or blink ? 	
A	605.68	637.21	Okay , my my idea is maybe that the minute it's really hidden , in in other words if it's like in a dark spot , uh meaning you know like a newspaper is on top , a sweater is on top or it it's behind a plant , at that moment it's it's like , it's like um , what you call it a light s sensors , you know ? In in that moment it has a sensor , i it it gets a certain darkness , it ge has a sensor and it gives out a signal whether that be a light signal or a beep , I mean , that we can discuss that later , you know . 	
D	613.3	613.69	Mm-hmm . 	
D	617.96	618.26	Mm-hmm . 	
D	625.55	626.237	Okay so 	
B	627.79	628.0	Yes . 	
D	628.29	628.67	Okay . 	
C	634.31	637.63	Yeah , probably yeah , probably it's a yeah , yeah . 	
B	638.22	639.184	Yeah . And uh 	
D	639.09	641.25	So the light sensor would activate the signal . 	
A	641.3	658.48	That's right . You know there would be right you have to have some kind of sensor and I I think uh voice or clapping it's not specific enough . Uh I know there are the lamps and stuff , you know , you can clap on and off , but I think they only work to certain degree and 	
C	641.81	642.12	Mm-hmm . 	
D	652.91	653.24	Mm-hmm . 	
B	653.7	654.09	Yes . 	
D	658.19	661.77	But it could be someplace really obvious and you still wouldn't be able to find it . 	
C	663.98	665.28	Yeah , of course , that didn't 	
A	664.08	664.8	What with 	
D	665.22	667.93	Well , because you're s because you're silly . Because people are silly . 	
B	665.4	666.38	Then , in that case 	
C	666.11	667.15	I i we can't do it . 	
A	667.7	671.808	Oh yeah well , but then those people we can't help everybody . 	
D	668.66	679.99	I mean it could be on well , i if it were like on top of your bookcase and you usually kept it on the coffee table um , you know , well maybe we have to move along , okay . 	
C	671.283	671.928		
A	678.08	683.95	Okay we have uh yeah , we have to move along , but I think we have some good good points to start with here . 	
C	682.07	683.11	Yeah , good point . 	
A	685.84	703.98	Okay , the next meeting will be in thirty minutes . I think you all did you get uh notices on your computer for this ? Okay so well , you got the notice um uh . The working design , I guess that's the function I_D_ uh who is this ? The industrial designer That's you . 	
C	691.65	692.33	Me yeah . 	
B	693.82	693.97	Yes . 	
C	702.97	703.28	Yeah . 	
C	704.61	707.73	Yeah , it's functional de yeah , exactly , technical . 	
A	706.82	711.13	Okay . So , we looking for a working design when we come back . 	
C	710.26	710.7	Yeah . 	
A	711.68	712.095		
C	711.71	715.68	Uh working design , yeah , it's it's uh mainly technical-functional design . 	
A	714.21	714.544	Then 	
A	715.72	744.656	And then the technical funct you are the technical function , so so you are the working design . So you have a working design and then a functional design . And the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirement specification , like friendliness , and what we just discussed in general . That would be your idea . And , of course , price . That it , that it , that the price is a good price . I mean , the price is given , but , that was 	
C	717.25	718.752	Yeah , functional design , and you 	
B	720.41	720.78	Okay . 	
D	741.37	741.7	Mm-hmm . 	
D	745.25	749.86	We have to justify that price by having sufficient features to make it sell at that price . 	
A	746.33	746.79	That's right . 	
A	749.44	750.08	That's right . 	
B	750.288	750.816		
A	751.38	758.0	And , you know , specifi you you will get specific um instructions for that . I think that's the end of the show . Yeah .
