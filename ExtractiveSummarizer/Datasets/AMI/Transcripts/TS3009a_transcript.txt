B	700.324	702.29		
C	706.66	708.17	Uh yeah uh blank . 	
A	708.4	717.856	Yep . So that's uh what we're going to use when we uh need it . Well it's terrific , eh ? 	
C	712.6	716.27	Well I feel comfortable now . Thanks for this exercise . 	
D	713.25	713.94	Oh great . 	
B	714.992	715.931

A	719.84	729.55	Yeah that's it . We're one big happy family now . Well then uh the serious uh stuff . 	
B	720.464	723.248	It certainly is . 	
D	725.232	725.488		
C	726.13	727.33	Yeah something like that . 	
A	731.04	741.2	We're we want to sell it at twenty five Euros internationally um so um but we dunno what exactly th i it is in dollars , but uh twenty five Euros . 	
A	742.29	746.57	Our profit aim is , worldwide , fifty million Euros . 	
C	747.58	747.872	So 	
A	747.94	768.41	So I didn't uh exactly uh calculate how much we have to sell . we want to keep it our costs at twelve and a half Euros so , keep uh that in mind when we uh talk about our uh materials an f and stuff , and uh marketing uh research . 	
C	752.8	754.208		
D	765.58	765.81	Right . 	
C	765.69	766.03	Alright . 	
A	771.46	785.17	Now then we all uh we can uh sit down and discuss uh what do we think about our current remote controls , first about design uh about uh aim in the market 	
A	786.45	796.096	etcetera ? Well uh we c we can sit down uh because uh presentation can wait . We can uh take notes and uh 	
D	787.17	787.37	Right . 	
A	797.34	802.56	Well who has uh some uh remarks about the current uh remote controls ? 	
C	805.01	813.664	Well I I didn't have to prepare anything about uh it's not , it's it's not my task to uh talk about uh experience with current remote controls , but uh 	
A	805.17	806.24	Please ? 	
A	808.15	810.176	No uh I did . 	
A	813.89	818.048	Well uh just w we're uh four uh if we if we would just have one then 	
D	816.5	821.82	I think it's im it's important to uh look at uh the remote controls of our competitors . 	
A	822.29	822.43	Yeah . 	
D	822.89	838.62	Get the good points uh try to merge them into one universal remote control . On our corporate site I saw uh a new D_V_D_ player uh we're gonna produce . Maybe it's important to make it compatible with the D_V_D_ player 	
A	827.73	828.01	Yeah yeah . 	
A	834.84	834.98	Yep . 	
A	836.04	836.63	That's alright . 	
A	839.38	840.78	That would be a nice idea , yes . 	
D	840.76	846.01	so you can uh use your television and your D_V_D_ player with the same uh remote control . 	
A	845.57	846.16	Yep yep yep . 	
D	847.67	859.53	Furthermore it's important to make it uh acceptable for the whole world , for different cultures , maybe , because we want to we want to well fifty million ? 	
A	860.11	862.86	Yes fifty million is our aim to a profit , so . 	
C	860.67	860.94	Mm-hmm . 	
D	861.84	865.41	Yeah yeah so a lot of people have to be able to use it . 	
B	862.832	863.646		
C	865.72	873.01	No but uh the b the buttons have to uh have to have uh international recognisable buttons and uh 	
D	866.18	866.988	So 	
B	867.17	868.0	Easy to learn . 	
D	868.23	868.47	Yeah . 	
D	873.67	874.11	Yeah that's right . 	
B	874.08	874.32	Yeah . 	
A	874.34	874.69	Yes . 	
C	874.37	880.44	and numbers and uh that every culture in uh , yeah , people in every country can recognise . 	
B	879.58	879.81	Yeah . 	
A	882.11	891.17	I'll make uh notes and then uh maybe uh well I'll put it in the project uh folder when I'm done uh just now . Well yeah ? 	
D	889.28	889.65	Mm-hmm . 	
C	889.78	890.33	Alright . 	
B	889.96	897.96	I also think we should not add too many buttons . Modern day uh remotes have too much buttons I think . 	
D	890.52	890.76	Right . 	
A	893.43	894.97	No that's right . 	
A	896.04	901.44	Y y you don't use uh the half of them that's that's culture uh international . 	
B	898.82	899.42	Precisely . 	
D	902.13	909.23	Maybe we could make one button to switch between D_V_D_ player and T_V_ and make the other buttons uh multi-functional or something . 	
B	905.95	906.21	Yeah . 	
B	908.98	910.18	Yeah indeed . 	
A	909.35	909.72	Yes . 	
C	909.35	913.696	Yeah so it doesn't uh become too complicated with too much buttons and uh 	
D	913.14	913.49	Yeah right . 	
A	913.64	921.68	Yep , and maybe we do uh we even have uh more than just a D_V_D_ player . Don't we have uh other uh ou 	
B	921.43	925.81	Yeah we should make it compatible perhaps with everything we use , we uh we make ? 	
C	923.03	925.78	And stereo uh s uh audio installations . 	
A	923.18	923.33	Uh . 	
A	924.41	929.11	We also uh just uh released a T_F_T_ uh thing I saw . 	
D	927.99	932.64	Yeah so but th that's kind kind of standard T_ television so it also works on that . 	
A	930.97	931.29	Yeah . 	
B	931.48	931.9	Yeah . 	
A	933.06	933.27	Yep . 	
B	934.17	942.47	And I think the people who who will buy our uh remote already have some experience with remotes . So we can keep that in mind . 	
C	941.78	942.89	Most people do , yeah . 	
A	943.37	943.93	Well yeah . 	
C	944.29	946.576	It doesn't it doesn't have to be 	
B	945.215	945.686		
A	945.31	947.65	It doesn't have to be , but we can . 	
B	946.92	953.47	W well it's a n it's a new remote and you don't buy a remote if you don't have anything to uh to control with it . 	
A	952.54	956.57	Well except if we deliver it together with our D_V_D_ . 	
D	953.58	953.936	Yeah but 	
C	955.89	956.32	Yeah . 	
B	956.55	958.05	Yeah alright , but 	
D	956.95	960.045	We need to to keep it consistent with other d uh 	
A	959.33	965.136	Yeah because we look at competitors and w if we pick up the good things about that and give it a nice design 	
C	959.64	959.92	Well . 	
C	965.4	965.67	Hmm . 	
D	966.21	968.92	Yeah but it's it has to be useable . 	
C	967.59	969.45	It has to be different and familiar at the same time . 	
A	969.7	969.97	Yes . 	
D	970.16	970.41	Yeah . 	
B	970.39	976.51	Yeah . Yeah we could use another form or shape or colour , that kind of things . 	
A	972.61	972.72	Yep . 	
C	975.056	989.69	yeah the shape will will have to be recognised . I thought about uh like most uh remote controls uh are uh a long box shaped thing you can make it uh triangle shaped , but that's not uh very recognisable . 	
A	985.67	985.85	Yeah . 	
D	987.597	989.84	No . 	
B	988.31	991.968	Well we we could make more more oval or something , and and 	
A	988.89	989.04	Oo 	
C	991.0	992.18	Oval ? 	
A	992.27	1004.35	N we can use uh it as a as a game pad . So one hand has the beer , so the other hand uh 	
C	992.71	993.058	I 	
B	992.89	993.6	Yeah or so 	
C	995.09	996.461	Mm . 	
B	995.47	997.152	Well yeah it's new . 	
D	995.776	996.584	. 	
D	997.43	1000.032	Not with two hands . 	
B	998.294	999.156		
D	1001.33	1003.936	Yeah yeah yeah , right . No 	
B	1002.947	1006.064	but young people want something different and it is 	
A	1006.12	1012.864	Well i we already uh one of our aims is that it has to be original and trendy so 	
D	1006.76	1009.71	Yeah but it's quite important that it fits . 	
B	1011.19	1011.66	Yeah . 	
D	1011.25	1011.47	Yeah . 	
C	1011.52	1017.632	Oh but it ha it has to be m yeah . But you still have to know it's a remote and not another 	
B	1017.72	1018.33	Yeah alright . 	
A	1017.88	1029.409	Well there has been done a lot of researches about remotes uh we have to we can imagine uh because it's a long time uh on the market . So the the form will have been uh tested out so 	
C	1024.85	1025.07	Yeah . 	
C	1028.97	1032.83	Yeah so the long box uh shaped thing must be uh , yeah , useful 	
A	1033.28	1033.6	Yes . 	
C	1034.39	1036.57	or else uh they would have been ano another shape . 	
A	1034.48	1056.96	Well for me personally I have a a lot of remotes uh at home but those ones that have a a round ending and uh well uh just an uh square uh middle I don't like to use them . I have uh have to it has to fit my hands . When it falls over it and I just have and then the button that I use most has to be here . 	
D	1051.34	1051.56	Yeah . 	
B	1051.89	1052.36	Yeah . 	
D	1054.44	1055.49	It shouldn't be boxy . 	
C	1054.76	1060.14	Yeah . Yeah a lo the long box shape yeah . You have to use one hand . 	
A	1058.72	1063.72	It f it fits your hands and then you just push the button that you use most with thumb . 	
D	1059.4	1059.994	Nah 	
D	1062.39	1067.03	I don't agree with the long box uh shape it it has to be custom made for the hand . 	
C	1064.56	1064.97	Why not ? 	
B	1067.7	1068.99	Yeah it doesn't fit . 	
A	1068.56	1071.71	Tho tho those new D_V_D_ players on the market do have those . 	
D	1068.67	1068.98	Yeah . 	
C	1069.7	1073.792	But it does fit in the hand if you hold it like this , and you can make it another shape , but then you have 	
D	1072.13	1073.338	Yeah but if you shape it 	
B	1073.93	1086.595	No if y if you look at new Phillips uh D_V_D_ with their uh remotes pl players they they are the new remotes aren't box shaped . They're all um 	
D	1074.26	1074.527	If 	
D	1078.816	1082.336		
A	1079.09	1081.44	D_V_D_ players . Yes . 	
C	1085.4	1086.79	W no w what else ? I di 	
D	1085.96	1087.8	No that's ol old fashioned . 	
B	1087.05	1087.551	Well 	
B	1088.2	1088.51	Yeah . 	
C	1088.88	1091.02	Yeah well but uh what what what do you suggest then ? 	
D	1089.12	1090.29	I can imagine that us 	
B	1089.6	1090.019	Yes uh 	
B	1091.12	1099.5	Well most of of them are are somewhat thicker at the end , and get um yeah thinner towards the uh the other end . 	
D	1091.43	1091.648	Well 	
D	1094.98	1095.48	Yeah right . 	
D	1097.16	1098.29	It fits in your palms . 	
C	1100.21	1112.251	Hmm . Well but it's still then uh the the long box , uh but then with some uh round uh round forms in it to fit your hand , but it's it's still 	
B	1100.71	1100.96	Mm . 	
B	1106.98	1107.629	Yeah it 	
D	1107.75	1107.93	Hmm ? 	
A	1108.07	1108.352	Well 	
A	1109.47	1116.4	A it h it has it it has a that's tha th th shape that it fits your hand . That's 	
D	1109.77	1110.25	Um . 	
C	1114.38	1121.77	Yeah yeah al alright but but it's still it's still sort of box , yeah . It it has round forms but it in the end it's still the box , so that's what I mean . 	
D	1117.056	1117.449	. 	
D	1118.885	1120.736	Well 	
B	1119.0	1119.59	Yeah yea 	
D	1124.02	1128.514	Yeah but it has it has to fit your hand . It shouldn't be too boxy , you know . It's 	
C	1126.23	1135.94	Yeah yeah I understand , but no no I don't mean an entire box like completely square but a also with round edges of course , but in in in at the end it's still this long 	
B	1128.21	1128.78	Hmm . 	
D	1129.872	1130.89	No no no . 	
A	1130.0	1132.352		
B	1130.409	1131.825		
B	1132.779	1133.337	. 	
D	1132.96	1133.15	Yeah . 	
D	1136.23	1137.376	Yeah it should be 	
C	1136.612	1141.37	box shape with convenient uh round uh shapes uh 	
A	1139.344	1140.265		
D	1141.81	1152.438	Right maybe something like this or and then a button here to switch between different systems like D_V_D_ player and so you can I've 	
C	1142.512	1143.47	to fit . 	
C	1145.03	1147.57	Yeah yes I thought about something like that . 	
C	1149.46	1149.61	Yeah . 	
C	1151.45	1153.49	A big recognisable button on top or something . 	
D	1153.17	1156.96	Yeah right , and I do think we have to keep this kind of idea 	
B	1156.94	1157.39	Yeah . 	
D	1158.66	1161.141	with the with the numbers and 	
A	1159.99	1163.128	We have five minutes left . So 	
C	1162.67	1168.97	The buttons should uh also be not too small , not too big , of course , and uh n uh uh not too close uh together . 	
D	1162.69	1162.9	Right . 	
B	1164.288	1164.496		
A	1165.67	1168.0	Yes uh that's yep . 	
D	1168.08	1171.71	But it should be possible to to um make it 	
D	1172.92	1179.94	ap apparent that there are two functions for every button . So there has to be some space between the buttons . Yeah . 	
A	1176.08	1176.24	Yep . 	
C	1176.32	1176.59	Uh-huh . 	
C	1179.11	1184.71	Yeah of course uh to uh to uh to have icons to explain the different functions . Yeah . 	
D	1183.38	1186.11	Yeah right right , and maybe we should use colours . 	
C	1186.69	1187.15	Colours , yeah . 	
B	1186.88	1203.898	Yeah maybe we can um just like on cell phones those um well you can you can put on on them , and so you can customise your uh your own remote with different colours or or special paint jobs I dunno but 	
D	1193.64	1193.9	Yeah . 	
A	1195.56	1195.71	Ha . 	
D	1195.89	1196.65	That's kinda trendy . 	
D	1201.43	1201.83	Yeah right . 	
A	1203.24	1204.51	Sound nice . Yes . 	
C	1204.68	1207.424	I think we have to talk also about uh the the materials for um 	
B	1208.56	1209.941	Well 	
A	1209.04	1219.27	Well it's just uh about our first ideas now so I think individually we'll have to uh come up with ideas for the next meeting about these materials and markets etcetera . Yes ? 	
C	1209.773	1211.703	. 	
D	1216.01	1216.33	Right . 	
C	1216.035	1216.391		
D	1217.28	1217.751	But 	
D	1218.461	1225.936	I think it's uh it's important to uh notate all the the decisions that we make , so we 	
C	1218.93	1220.576	Already thought about something tha 	
A	1223.84	1224.19	Yes . 	
A	1227.28	1231.12	Well thirty minutes we have . So um 	
C	1229.52	1229.79	Mm-hmm . 	
B	1229.853	1230.672		
A	1232.87	1242.43	This is about uh what we are going to uh do uh . You'll get specific instructions when you're back in your room so uh it's uh logical uh . I think . 	
D	1238.38	1238.66	Yeah . 	
B	1239.024	1239.232	. 	
D	1242.174	1243.58	No problem . 	
A	1243.73	1251.9	Oh and uh that's uh that's all . So we'll just get a notice that the the meeting is uh over . Yeah yes say . 	
C	1249.8	1260.49	Yeah now we can still talk about the material , we have some some minutes left uh I w wrote down uh that the case should be plastic of course , hard plastic , the buttons should be uh rubbery I think uh . 	
B	1251.71	1252.02	Mm . 	
D	1257.89	1258.13	Yeah . 	
D	1260.72	1261.93	Yeah it shouldn't be too heavy . 	
B	1261.376	1261.872	. 	
C	1262.4	1263.13	No n n 	
B	1262.603	1263.232	. 	
A	1262.85	1279.84	Well I have had remotes that um they had uh the function of the buttons was about uh uh a layer over the buttons and when I've had use it much it was gone . So it has to be made in the buttons I think . It has to uh not be loose . 	
B	1274.28	1275.82	Yeah that's bad , yeah . 	
D	1274.44	1275.18	Yeah yeah yeah . 	
B	1279.05	1280.12	Yeah that's important . 	
C	1280.39	1287.81	Mm . Alright . And of course there are several electrical cables in it to uh to connect things uh to each other . 	
A	1285.03	1285.26	Yeah . 	
A	1286.66	1294.39	Is there an a universal uh universal way of um transmitting from the remote to the television so it's all about uh 	
D	1294.13	1295.5	Yeah it's univ yeah yeah yeah . 	
C	1294.23	1301.19	I think so . It's a a common stan standard way infrared beams an infrared beam I think . 	
A	1295.49	1297.13	It's not that in China it's different ? 	
D	1297.65	1297.87	Yep . 	
A	1300.42	1300.7	Yeah . 	
A	1302.1	1306.558	But y you can have uh of course different between D_V_D_s and televisions and between 	
D	1303.3	1303.962	And you can use 	
C	1305.72	1312.66	It it's a we we make an a universal remote so it ha has to work with uh all kinds of brands and things . 	
D	1307.81	1308.06	Yeah . 	
A	1309.69	1309.95	Yeah . 	
B	1310.08	1310.53	Yeah . 	
B	1312.34	1316.038	But our T_V_s are mostly made in China and that sort of country , so 	
A	1315.008	1321.152	Probably yes . China rules . 	
D	1315.074	1320.416		
B	1319.024	1319.6		
C	1319.447	1320.0		
C	1321.09	1332.398	And have well yeah I've wrote something down about how it works . The user presses a button and with an infrared beam it signals the television set accordingly , but that's pretty obvious , I think . 	
A	1328.129	1328.991		
D	1328.21	1329.336	But are 	
D	1331.264	1336.31	Are we going w uh with the front uh fronts uh idea ? 	
B	1331.503	1332.592		
A	1331.696	1332.72		
A	1336.8	1340.7	Well I think uh w we can look into that in the in the next uh thirty minutes . Yeah . 	
D	1338.04	1347.408	I think we should make it universal and you can always use a front front on it , you know ? You can use it just plain but you can 	
A	1346.34	1346.57	Yes . 	
B	1346.655	1347.232	. 	
A	1348.05	1354.048	Well j just y you get a n a normal front with it , but you can change them uh when you buy the 	
D	1348.29	1349.12	To make it more trendy . 	
B	1348.586	1349.004		
B	1351.3	1351.52	Yeah . 	
D	1352.79	1353.01	Right . 	
B	1353.3	1354.56	Yes . Yes . 	
D	1354.12	1354.32	Right . 	
A	1355.28	1360.192	And we should uh dispatch those kind of fronts fronts a a around the world so uh 	
B	1358.34	1358.48	Mm . 	
D	1358.555	1360.45	Yeah . 	
B	1359.77	1363.39	Well you can make profit with them , and it's a way to make them trendy . 	
A	1363.44	1370.89	Well th those fifty million don't uh don't se sells itself so we have to uh make uh some extra effort like fronts uh . 	
C	1370.63	1376.36	Well but th but the standard front will be uh just grey or something uh b a simple colour not not very flashy . 	
D	1370.98	1371.3	Yeah right . 	
B	1371.14	1371.76	Yeah alright . 	
B	1373.76	1374.85	Yeah normal . 	
A	1374.44	1386.528	Yes . Yeah well it has to it h it has to fit the the te television and D_V_D_ set we are going to sell , so if they are uh black and black black and silver we'll make them black and silver so 	
B	1376.25	1377.87	No a colour everyone accepts . 	
B	1381.5	1381.7	Mm . 	
C	1382.91	1385.63	Pink television sets pink remote , . 	
B	1383.93	1384.16	Mm . 	
D	1385.11	1385.75	Yeah yeah yeah . 	
B	1386.2	1386.45	Yeah . 	
B	1387.616	1388.34	standard . 	
D	1388.58	1392.69	But people of often don't like bright colours or something . We have to make it grey or s or black . 	
A	1391.17	1391.548	. 	
B	1392.44	1395.04	Well young people s li 	
D	1393.96	1396.34	Yeah but then you can use a a front . 	
B	1396.21	1397.16	Yeah yeah , yeah . 	
C	1398.96	1399.23	Alright . 	
A	1401.44	1401.74	Yeah . 	
C	1402.48	1405.024	I must not forget my pen the next time . 	
A	1403.48	1414.0	Well if if you yeah . If you have a a a television room for little children and you make a if if you buy a a pink front they'll they'll love it . I think . 	
B	1403.917	1405.025		
B	1413.09	1413.31	Yeah . 	
D	1413.34	1413.93	Yeah that's right . 	
D	1414.95	1421.0	Yeah or a t Teletubby front . Yeah yeah yeah . I will investigate . 	
A	1415.09	1420.048	But that's uh marketing uh research you can uh you can ask uh .
